[Footprints of Change]

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.680
[Episode 7]

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.350
Zhaoyuan.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.000
Fine, Zhou Zhaoyuan, Zhou Zhaoyuan.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.120
I want to apply to military school

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.039
and serve on the front lines
against the Japanese.

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.820
That's great.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.380
Then you're sure
to become an excellent soldier.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.790
Don't laugh. I mean it.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.150
I mean it, too.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.590
If you need it,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.530
I'll write you a recommendation letter.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.520
Right now, all I want is to graduate
from middle school as soon as possible.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.630
There was a man in the Song dynasty

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.810
who saw his crops weren't growing,
so he pulled them up

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.960
and went home exhausted.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.090
What does that mean?

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.630
Pulling up seedlings
to help them grow never works.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.400
See?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.450
You really should read more books.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.150
I'm done with you.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.800
Are you mad?

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:27.300
No.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.350
I'll take you out for butterfly cookies.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.670
Two boxes.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.120
Okay.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.980
Deal.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.750
Let's go.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.040
Thanks for helping me this time.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.730
What do you mean?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.770
It's a gift for your grand opening.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.910
Have a seat.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.550
I'm sorry.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.079
I used to be selfish

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.750
and foolish,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.630
always blind to my own faults.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.730
Coming back to the old house

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.400
seeing it like this

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.240
makes me truly happy.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.160
And seeing
your maternity hospital doing so well,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.590
I'm genuinely

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.060
happy for you, too.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.400
I mean it.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.640
Since Mom is staying at your place,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.840
you should take good care of her.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.640
I understand.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.070
Mom's staying with me

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.030
and is being well taken care of,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.120
so don't worry.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.850
Your sister-in-law

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.399
cooks three meals a day,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.560
and all of them Mom's favorites.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.070
When I have time,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.960
I also take her out for walks

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.100
and chats.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.430
Mom's really happy.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.710
It's just that sometimes

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.640
she talks to herself,

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.600
saying she misses you a lot.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.440
Why don't you go visit her

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.950
when you're not busy?

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.750
I'm really sorry.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.830
This gift

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.430
isn't expensive.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.770
Just think of it as a small token

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.950
of my appreciation for your grand opening,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:07.600
okay?

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.270
Please take good care of Meina.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.500
She's very delicate,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.390
and since it's her first pregnancy,

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.750
please look after her.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.040
Meina?

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.240
Shao Meina?

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.680
The relative
Sis brought over yesterday?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.390
Yeah.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.630
What's your relationship with her?

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.670
No, our mom

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.500
is really happy this time.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.310
I mean...

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.530
Mom asked

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.070
if you could

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.360
waive that fee for her.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.830
We're all family.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.460
Can't you just waive the fee?

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.560
Sis,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.720
what are you doing?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.630
Siyun is here.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.420
Her feet are swollen,
so I'm soaking them for her.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.820
Come with me to my office.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.750
You go ahead then.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.600
When you come back,
peel two apples for me.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.110
Get out of the way.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.630
What are you looking at?

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.230
I'm not done washing my feet.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.360
I'll help you.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.600
Why are you so afraid of your sister?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.730
Didn't you say this hospital is yours?

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.040
She's just helping you out, isn't she?

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.240
I'm not afraid of her.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.900
She's my little sister.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.430
I was being nice to her.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.360
You're not lying to me, are you?

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.790
Why would I lie to you?

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.990
I've been running this hospital
for quite a while.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.820
Why did you wash her feet?

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.830
All I can do

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.000
is take care of the Lin family.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.430
You don't need to do things like that!

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.510
It's fine.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.570
I can endure it.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.750
You can endure it?

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.409
For how long?

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.480
For a lifetime?

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.800
I'll endure it...

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.300
for as long as it takes.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:39.740
Mr. Cheng.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.440
One of the few optimists.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.820
I'd like to ask you a favor.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.650
Some of my student friends

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.450
want to join
the volunteer army in the northeast.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.630
Wu Xiaoshan?

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.350
Yes.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.480
Sure,

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.390
I'll make the arrangements.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.360
Thank you.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.570
I'd like to ask you a favor, too.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.550
We urgently need a batch of medicine

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.880
and medical equipment.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.240
Here's the medicine list and the deposit.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.270
I only have one month

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.600
to gather and send them
to the front lines.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.840
It's not easy to find
such a large quantity

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.610
of medicine and equipment.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.400
I'll figure something out.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:39.530
Keep the money.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.970
I'll cover the cost.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.840
That's a lot of money.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.190
Consider it a token of my appreciation.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.080
Fine.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.110
I'll contact you

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.200
in a month.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.350
Take care.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.630
Cheng Ao, Cheng Ao.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.250
Come and eat.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.200
You're back.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.510
Why didn't you tell us in advance?

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.910
I wanted to surprise you.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.410
Go get Master.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.360
Okay.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.270
Come try my pickled cabbage pork stew.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.360
This pot, half a pig,

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.840
and a few pounds of pickled cabbage—

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.950
I carried them all back
from the Northeast.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:43.630
Here.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.030
Did you go to the Northeast to be a chef?

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.030
Of course not.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.750
I only cook for family.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.630
Dad.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.200
You're back.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.240
You're only back because
you squandered all your money, right?

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.240
No, that's not it.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.150
Call her Mom.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.630
Mom.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.490
It's your turn.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.460
Madam Yanhong.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.550
This is Dalun.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.550
But don't believe

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.350
a word he says.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.790
This is Cheng Ao,

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.360
our family's great lawyer.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.840
Father, you're really something.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.870
I just got back,

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.180
and suddenly
there's another little brother.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.650
You're still
so full of energy at your age.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:53.650
Enough nonsense.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.550
Say it. Why are you back this time?

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.150
I came back to look after you.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.650
I can't afford that kind of care.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.870
Seriously,

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.160
I came back

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.990
with a government job this time.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.270
Wherever you work,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.800
don't cause me any more trouble.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:12.400
Don't worry.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.540
It's good to have you back.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.840
How were things
with the Japanese in the Northeast?

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.200
Cheng Ao, what are you talking about?

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.870
How could I ever have dealings with them?

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.270
Dad taught us from childhood

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.070
never to deal with the Japanese.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.010
Dad, I've always kept that in mind.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.320
So, what did you cook?

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.060
Let me see.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.680
Have a seat, Yanhong.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.600
Dalun,

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.600
have the brothers sit and eat.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.020
Everyone, come sit and keep eating.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:46.840
Cheng Ao,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.580
I was gone for just a while,

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.400
and now I have another brother?

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.840
How would I know?

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.960
It's my first time seeing her, too.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.430
How do you know it's a boy?

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.350
I've actually looked into this.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.030
If the belly is pointy, it's a boy.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.490
If it's round, it's a girl.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.020
Hurry up.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.600
Coming.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:12.920
Here, Father.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.080
Here, Mom.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.020
Thank you.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:20.710
Thank you, my dear.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:22.240
Dad.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.600
Why not sit there?

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.680
I just got back,
so I wanted to sit close to you.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.580
Aren't you hot?

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.030
This jacket's yours now.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.120
Is it good?

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.430
Did you rob a salt vendor or what?

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.240
Try it yourself.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.030
Yeah, it seems a bit salty.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.910
Just a bit?

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.800
Don't drink too much.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.280
[Sinan Maternity Hospital]

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.030
Who are you?

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.990
I'm Lin Jinghan's daughter.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.630
Oh, it's you.
Lin Jinghan told me about you.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.320
I brought you some food.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.450
Did you make all this yourself?

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.750
There are vegetables, meat, and soup.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.550
Go ahead, eat.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.260
You're so thoughtful.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.260
My dad said

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.690
we should treat you well.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.240
Things were better before.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.200
At least this house was still ours.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.480
What did you say?

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.410
When Grandpa was alive,

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.030
our family was very wealthy.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.600
Later, my grandpa passed away,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.000
and my dad ran up a lot of debt,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.460
so this house was mortgaged
to his creditor.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.640
He used all the money
from selling the house to pay off debts.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.000
Not a single penny was left.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.790
He still hasn't paid off the bank loans.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.790
My dad's broke.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.480
He's got nothing but debt.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.390
You're saying Lin Jinghan's broke?

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.790
Isn't this hospital his?

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.270
This hospital isn't my father's.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.630
It belongs to my aunt.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.230
It has nothing to do with him.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.390
He still owes the money
for your hospitalization.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.080
Dad.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.250
What are you doing here?

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.360
I came to bring her food.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.310
Food's here. I'll get going.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.880
Come, sit here.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.330
What did she come here for?

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.110
Your daughter just told me

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.660
that you're broke,

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.940
and this hospital isn't yours either.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.400
Was she telling the truth?

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.170
Of course not!

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.670
She lied to you.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.970
That kid never tells the truth.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.080
Jinghan, be honest with me.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.480
I'm with you,

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.120
carrying your baby

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.460
because I love you for who you are,

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.390
not for your money.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.510
Even if you're broke,

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.720
it doesn't matter.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.250
We can still earn together.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.080
But I hope the one I love

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.720
tells me the truth

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.880
and doesn't lie.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.390
I'll tell you the truth.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.950
Promise you won't get mad?

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:22.660
Sure.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.290
Couples should be honest with each other.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:32.990
Yes,

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.890
I did lie to you.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.440
But wasn't that because I love you?

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.010
I...

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.800
I just...

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.110
I was just afraid that in my state,

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.150
I'd lose you.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:53.680
I'm not having this baby!

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.890
I never should've married
a woman like you.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.240
Sis,

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.829
I don't pity you.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.210
I care about you.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.859
I know you want to be
a good daughter-in-law to the Lin family,

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:23.790
and a good mother to your children.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.089
But sometimes, when it's necessary,

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.680
you need to be selfish

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.080
and think more about yourself.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.280
I understand what you mean.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.840
I've thought about that too.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.290
Whenever Lin Jinghan acts ridiculously,

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:41.940
I really want to take my kids

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.440
and leave the Lin family
without looking back.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.720
But where could I go?

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.640
Back to my parents' home?

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.400
I can already picture the villagers

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.250
drowning me with their gossip.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.110
I can hardly support myself.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.920
I can't let my kids suffer with me, can I?

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.810
It's not that you can't—

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.690
you just don't dare.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.830
You still have me.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.830
Mom, I avenged you.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.760
What do you mean?

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.930
You'll see when we get there.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.460
Let's go.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:14.820
Hurry up.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.530
Why is your nose bleeding?

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.590
Yi's soup is good.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.110
I just had a few sips.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.110
Are you okay?

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:46.990
I'm fine.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.280
Then let me tell you something.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.960
Go ahead.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.040
I already covered the medical bills

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.450
from the past few days.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.960
But the hospital shareholders said

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.510
if you don't pay the rest,

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.570
they'll sue you.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.600
You could even be detained.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.130
Don't bring that up with me.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.770
My baby's not even born yet.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.370
Why should I pay the rest now?

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.720
Besides,

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.920
don't treat family like outsiders.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.440
We're family.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.550
Asking me for money

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.600
only hurts our feelings.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.640
Auntie, you already tried talking to him.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.570
My dad just won't listen. Let's go.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.380
Wipe your nose.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:41.480
What should we do?

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.480
Are they really going to detain you?

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.960
Actually,

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.500
our house is pretty comfortable.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.320
Why don't we just go home?

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:54.880
Besides,

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.860
If I get detained,

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.110
no one will take care of you.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.730
You still need care after childbirth.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.160
Sometimes you put up with the small stuff
for the bigger plan.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.160
How did I marry such a useless man?

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.560
Honey...

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.320
Do you want me to slap you again?

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.370
Let's pack up.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:23.790
Stay right there.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.310
Zeng Dalun.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:33.920
Why are you back?

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.430
When did you get back?

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:36.290
I just got back.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.570
Hold on. Why are you dressed like that?

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.110
Shouldn't you be in a long gown

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.170
with a bunch of sidekicks behind you?

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.000
You came here today—

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.010
Did you get yourself into trouble again?

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.890
That mess with Xiu last time—

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.450
you caused such a big scene!

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.400
Your father's been
cleaning up after you every day.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.660
You're the eldest son of the Zeng family.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.610
Can't you give your family a break?

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.910
So tell me, what is it this time?

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.940
Let's see if I can help.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.870
No need.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:12.750
I found a job.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.880
With your status,
you don't need to find a job.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.510
Just don't cause your father more trouble.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.440
I'm working for Mr. Dai now.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.510
Mr. Dai?

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.270
Which Mr. Dai?

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.880
How many Mr. Dais do you think there are?

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:40.610
Dalun,

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.200
it's been ages

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.570
since we last met.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.590
How about this?
Tomorrow night, dinner's on me.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.720
Let me throw you a welcome party, okay?

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.160
Hello, this is Pingzheng Law Firm.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:06.620
Hello?

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.240
This is Shen Yiqun.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:09.830
What's wrong?

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:10.720
Do me a favor.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.310
Set up a dinner for me and Zeng Dalun.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.800
Why do you want to have dinner with Dalun?

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.320
Don't ask why.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.400
Just set it up for me.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.670
I'll have someone send you
the address tomorrow.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.150
Alright, got it.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:13.700
[Registration Counter]

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.480
I never thought

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.790
you'd actually open a hospital
on your own.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.250
And it's doing quite well.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.740
That's thanks to Mrs. Shen's foresight.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.270
I planned to leave without a word,

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.330
but then I thought,

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.070
I should come and see you one last time.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.110
Where are you going?

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.200
I'm going abroad to study.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.000
That's great.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.330
What will you study?

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.160
Aren't you going to ask me?

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.510
What are you going to study?

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.640
I'm going to New York to study finance.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.080
You should work hard.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.080
When I'm back from the U.S.,

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.720
I'll buy your hospital.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.830
Goodbye, Lin Siyun.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.120
I thought she'd study medicine.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.720
Why?

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:03.670
To follow in your footsteps.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.110
You're so outstanding.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.140
Every girl in Shanghai

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.270
sees you as a role model, right?

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.640
Didn't you notice

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.180
she didn’t even look at you just now?

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.420
Do you know why?

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.350
Why?

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:25.460
Cheng Ao,

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.010
you've lost your charm.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.670
Mom, if you keep living in that house,

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.440
Dad and his mistress will drive you crazy!

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.160
Why don't you come work with Auntie?

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.880
Look at Mrs. Chen—she can't even read

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.560
but she's learning
to be a midwife with Auntie.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.830
Mom, don't you see?

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.640
Dad never treated us
as decent human beings.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.100
He sold me to the Zhu family

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.700
just to pay off his gambling debt.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.580
And now he's even making you
take care of his mistress,

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.640
which triggered your heart disease!

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.440
Mom, my little brother's still so young.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.550
We all need you.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.720
Dr. Lin,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
I have something important to ask.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.170
That's quite a lot.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.920
These medicines and equipment
are hard to get,

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.480
and they're all under quota limits.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.330
The amount you're asking for is so large.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.520
Even if I gave you
the hospital's entire stock,

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.520
it still wouldn't be enough.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.590
How about this?

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.690
I’ll find a way.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.410
I'll order more under the hospital's name.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.240
I only have one month

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.100
to gather this batch of medicine.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.940
Your hospital alone
definitely won't cover it.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.590
If I go to the national hospital,

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.390
it surely will raise suspicion.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.680
So I'm thinking of
going through foreign hospitals,

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.850
like the missionary hospital
or the Red Cross hospital.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.890
Do you have connections there?

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.440
I know people at both.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.790
But the quantity
you're asking for is huge.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.670
You'd better come up
with a convincing reason.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.550
Why are you buying

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.720
so much medicine?

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.960
Getting medical supplies is obviously

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.090
for saving lives and doing good deeds.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.520
What good deeds?

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.270
I can't tell you right now.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.480
You're asking me for a favor,
and you won't even tell me that?

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.480
I'll tell you when the time is right.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.310
What's wrong with you?

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.710
Asking for a favor,
but only telling half the story.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:56.070
What's wrong with you?

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.490
You're way too curious.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.390
I'm not curious

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.820
about everyone, okay?

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.490

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.100

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.460
I'm busy.

You're here.

You got here pretty early.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.720
Since I'm having dinner
with my two best brothers,

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.180
of course I had to come early
to set things up.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:10.520
Cheng Ao,

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.200
since you invited us,

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.480
you should take the main seat.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.130
Sit.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:16.640
Dalun,

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:17.670
come and sit here.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:34.430
Give me your glass.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:35.890
Alright.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.280
My two brothers,

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.880
I'm a few years older than you two,

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.880
so let me say a few words first, okay?

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.310
I came early,

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.500
so I went ahead and ordered the dishes.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.030
There are meat and vegetables,
quite a feast.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.510
Cheng Ao, for this first glass,

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:05.570
don't drink it yet.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.880
I want to toast Dalun.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:08.680
Dalun,

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.070
you've been away for quite a long time.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.790
You must've suffered a lot

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.070
and faced some hardships out there,

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.750
right?

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.200
But now you're back,

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.540
and we're here to welcome you home.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.170
Cheers.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.550
Cheng Ao, let me tell you.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.480
Dalun's done well in his study.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.110
He came back with real accomplishments.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.920
Now he's working for Mr. Dai.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.160
Trust me,

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.590
in two years at most,

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.520
Dalun will definitely be

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.400
the top leader in our department.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:48.510
By then,

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.540
I'll serve you with all I've got.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.180
Alright, it's time to eat.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:06.550
Let's raise our glasses

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.000
and make a toast.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.070
Cheers.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.790
Shen Yiqun.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.920
I really hate you.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:14.950
You should know that, right?

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.200
I really had no idea.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.110
Did I do something wrong

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.960
that upset you?

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.320
Tell me and I'll change.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:24.530
Cheng Ao.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.310
Don't you find him annoying as well?

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.310
Let's eat.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.030
Shen Yiqun.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.000
Look how hypocritical you are.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.640
You always tell people
what they want to hear.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.520
Especially when you meet someone,

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.380
you always put on that fake smile.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.770
It's disgusting.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.270
It makes me sick.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.030
You know what?

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.480
You're nothing but a hypocrite.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.200
Do you think you deserve to dine with me?

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.880
Who do you think you are?

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:01.000
Stand up.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:03.790
Go take a piss

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.210
and take a look at yourself.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.510
Were you even born a human?

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:12.110
Dalun.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.110
You don't want to eat properly, huh?

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.710
Then let me treat you to something else.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.610
You brought the military police
to dine with me?

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:34.440
No,

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.510
Cheng Ao, don't get the wrong idea.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:37.720
We're brothers.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.510
I trust you completely.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.440
But him?

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.580
He's not worthy.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.920
Zeng Dalun.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:53.170
You still don't know your place.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:55.960
You've only been
in the Shanghai circle for a few years,

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.890
and you're already this arrogant?

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.080
A gang has its rules,
and a family has its own laws.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.420
In terms of seniority,

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.280
you're nowhere close to me.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:08.820
Take him out.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.080
Teach him a lesson.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.270
Alright, alright.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.430
Dalun, apologize to him.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.150
Do you think this is acceptable?

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.080
You're really tough.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.870
When you act tough like this,

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.080
it actually scares me a little.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.980
I can't just let a tiger
return to the mountain.

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:09.750
So...

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:13.140
you'd better not leave.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.060
Kill him.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.710
It doesn't take two guns to kill one man.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.590
Come on.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.880
Tell your men to do it.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.630
Come on.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.420
Come on!

00:33:59.030 --> 00:33:59.680
Dalun,

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:01.370
let's go.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.940
You didn't bring
the military police this time?

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.360
It was my fault

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.490
for bringing you two together for a meal.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:37.410
I'm sorry.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.780
I just hope you're not mad.

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:42.480
Wait a minute.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:54.150
This is the first time

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:57.080
I've ever drunk like this for a man.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.110
The last time I drank like this,

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.110
I was 20 years old.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.330
I drank like that for a girl.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:04.710
She was going to study abroad,

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.440
and I rode my bike to see her off.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:53.760
Where are you going?

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.090
I'm going to see a movie.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.280
Sis,

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.670
I really didn't expect

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:42.330
Yi could convince you and Mom.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.220
I'm quite surprised.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:47.150
She's your mother's eldest grandchild.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:48.480
Don't you know her well?

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.320
Siyun.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.700
I don't know anything about this.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.150
Can I really make it?

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.590
Sis,

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.070
don't be nervous.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.890
I'll teach you step by step.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:04.410
Siyun,

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.400
thank you.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.810
Don't be formal with me.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.550
Alright, I won't be formal then.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.510
I'll definitely try my best to learn.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.030
Let's go

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.760
Let's go.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.040
Dalun, what happened to your hand?

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.120
It's nothing.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.150
I got injured during a mission.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:25.150
It's good that it's nothing serious.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.800
I have something to tell both of you.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.280
We've recently received intel

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.680
that the Communist Party

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.470
is planning several
large-scale operations in Shanghai.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:33.880
I want both of you to investigate it.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.000
You must find out

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.800
exactly what they're plotting.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.550
Director,

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:39.070
I've received intel on this too.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.230
The moment I got the message,

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.510
I sent people to investigate.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:43.440
I believe we'll have results soon.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.320
Jin.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.880
This is a list

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.040
of Communists I've recently captured,

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.190
including some pro-Communist people.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:03.510
Recruit those we can,

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:04.600
and for the rest,

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.590
arrest them all.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.200
Those who resist publicly,

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.590
kill them all.

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:11.410
But...

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.600
do not reveal your identity.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:18.400
Yiqun,

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.970
Dalun's been working
at the periphery for us.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.610
You two must stay united

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.960
and work diligently together.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.090
The organization is fair
with rewards and punishments.

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:32.950
Director, rest assured,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.110
we'll work hard

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.330
and stay united.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.250
Good. Cheers.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:49.540
[Light Theater]

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:01.400
About that batch of medicine
you mentioned last time,

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.930
I've thought of a solution.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.480
Sichuan is currently

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:08.230
suffering from famine and plague.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.720
We can hold a charity fundraiser

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:14.560
for the disaster victims
under the hospital's name.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.140
First, we can actually help the victims.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.330
Second, it gives you a cover

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.030
to collect the medicine
and equipment you need.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.740
You can blend in legitimately

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.070
without arousing suspicion.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.200
I thought of that too.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.680
With such a large demand,

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.590
a charity fundraiser is the only option.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.070
And with this excuse,

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.870
we can also contact
the local Red Cross hospital.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.960
They must have

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.090
a large quantity of this type of medicine.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.230
We're on the same page.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.360
That solves the supply problem.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.670
But with the current drug controls,

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:00.480
have you figured out how to

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.010
move them from Shanghai
to your destination?

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:05.480
Not yet.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.560
Let's watch the movie first.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.280
Someone's following us.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.250
Don't look.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:54.080
It could be one of Zeng Dalun's men.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.230
Cheng Ao,

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.080
your hands are sweating.

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:28.430
There's no Zeng Dalun's people
here at all, right?

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:36.610
Maybe I was mistaken.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:42.320
It's nice holding hands
while watching a movie like this.
