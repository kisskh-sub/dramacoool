[Episode 5]

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.710
Miss Lin, we're here to see the house.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.640
I saw your

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.210
house-for-sale ad in the paper,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.810
so I asked Aunt Nan to come with me
to take a look.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.870
I've also been wanting

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.220
to thank you, Mrs. Shen.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.150
You certainly should thank Auntie Nan.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.210
If it weren't for her supporting you,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.230
the outcome between you

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.310
and your brother
might have been different.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.480
Don't say that.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.030
I was just speaking fairly

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.520
from an objective standpoint.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.980
It wasn't that important.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.800
Well,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.080
I still owe you thanks.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.190
Mrs. Shen,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.960
Miss Shen,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.930
please, come in.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.530
Okay.

♪ Willow buds break, rouge fades light ♪

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.600
This is our foyer.

♪ New green spreads across bronze stone ♪

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.579
And this is the living room.

♪ Maple embers glow,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.400
Aunt Nan,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.280
I'll take a look around myself.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.730
♪ Frost descends, and the hair entangled ♪

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.280
Alright.

Miss Lin,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.700
I heard from Mr. Cheng that

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.170
you settled with your brother
out of court.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.100
What are your plans now?

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.620
♪ Snow veils the steps,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.310
Will you still open

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.320

♪ Hearth-fire dims, tea smoke thins ♪

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.080

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.630
definitely will.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.060
I'm currently looking for investors.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.130
♪ In every crease, the years are etched ♪

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.770

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.050
Yes.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.040
I even paid the deposit.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.910
♪ Hatred dissolves, love remains ♪

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.230

this weekend,

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.100
Yingying's father is hosting

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.079

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.450
one of his occasional gatherings

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.340
with colleagues and business friends.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.940
Besides some officials,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.960
many well-known businessmen

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.079
and financiers in Shanghai will be there.

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.800
Since you're looking for investors,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.430
why not go there and give it a try?

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.470
That would be wonderful.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.670
thank you, Mrs. Shen.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.560

Could you please buy this house for me?

♪ Face in the mirror

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.079
I think the layout

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.190
and lighting here are pretty good.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.760

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.800
I can invite my friends over—

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.780
two birds with one stone.

Lin Siyun,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.620
I'll give you a VIP card then.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.940
♪ Frost descends, and the hair entangled ♪

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.000
That area is full of
makeshift shelters that laborers

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.230
from the countryside built themselves,

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.540
causing all sorts of problems.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.430
The government has been trying to clear it

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.310
and move the nomads out.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.270
But once some are gone,
others just keep coming.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.870
With no other choice,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.130
the government issued

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.230
this final eviction notice.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.660
Unexpectedly,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.310
a fire broke out last night,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.970
and all those people ran to...

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.590
You think I don't know this?

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.510
Am I blind or deaf?

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.240
Huang,

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.909
how old are you this year?

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.680
Have you no shame?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.420
You're shameless.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.720
Yes.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.870
Are you even human?

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.240
I'm beginning to think you're not.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.800
All sorts of problems?

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.680
If there weren't so many problems,
would this mess be dumped on me?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.630
"Once some are gone,
others just keep coming?"

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.680
You're so shameless.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.040
You should kneel before their doors,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.360
begging them to leave one by one.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.270
Did you do that?

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.040
You're right.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.310
What's the point
of bowing and nodding to me?

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.040
Go handle it!

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.190
go fix it!

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.950
Yes, I...

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.510
Get out!

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.360
Okay.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.930
Isn't this my buddy Cheng Ao?

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.870
So?

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.530
Have you decided about
coming to work in my department?

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.850
Where was Huang standing just now?

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.130
Here.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.130
You were sitting, weren't you?

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.770
Sit down.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.300
What are you doing?

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.010
Pretend I'm Huang

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.390
and yell at me like you just did to him.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.790
I want to see how it feels,

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.920
so I can decide if I can work for you.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.920
Come on.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.190
Do all lawyers

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.480
like eavesdropping

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.800
on people?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.940
Where's this confidence coming from?

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.200
What's the point
of listening to your insulting nonsense?

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.070
Lawyer Cheng,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.000
those words

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.390
make you seem rather uncultured.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.780
Not really.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.160
I only talk to you like this.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.600
So tell me,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.970
why are you here?

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.430
Don't you always want to serve the country

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.600
and do something for the people?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.490
Perfect timing.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.360
There's something I need you to do now.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:42.750
What is it?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.060
Come with me. I'll tell you on the way.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.980
Where are we going?

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.790
Someone set fire in the shantytown
last night.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.550
Did I ask you to speak?

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.640
Who did it? Have they been caught?

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.020
It doesn't matter who did it.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.800
What can you do even if you catch them?

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.000
Their objective is clear:

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.390
they're dissatisfied with the government.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.240
What's most important now
is calming these laborers

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.100
so they don't cause more trouble.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.230
So why do you need me?

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.430
These people at the bottom of society

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.360
distrust the government completely.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.160
Cheng Ao,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.490
you're in a gang

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.710
and you're a lawyer.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.160
You'll be more persuasive
when communicating with them.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.160
I need you to

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.870
have a good talk with them.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.000
So you just want to use my status
as a gang member, huh?

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.270
Director Shen has always admired

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.870
your character and ability.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.240
This task of calming the people
is a heavy responsibility.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.120
He can only

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.900
trust you with it.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.960
Huang,

00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:59.340
you finally said something right.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.630
You little brat!

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.510
You just yelled at someone, didn't you?

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.120
Yes.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.670
What's wrong with a kid
throwing coal at the car?

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.480
Did it hit you?

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.390
No.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.000
Then why did you yell at him?

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.790
Why did you yell at a child?

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.600
If someone yelled at your child,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.030
how would you feel?

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.600
That's just a child.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:31.550
Apologize.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.200
I'm sorry.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.580
Why are you apologizing to me?

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.260
Apologize to the person

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.320
you just yelled at.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.790
I'm sorry.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.670
I'm sorry, everyone.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:57.550
Huang,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
is this how you do your work?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.200
You should be uniting everyone

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.700
and thinking about what's best for them.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.420
Got it?

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.250
Got it, got it.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.510
I... I...

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.870
I'll definitely change.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.360
I'll definitely do better next time.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.890
Don't you work for Mr. Zeng?

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.410
Are you also working for the government?

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.900
Yes.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.670
I work for Mr. Zeng.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.480
I'm here

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.740
mainly to cooperate with the government

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.500
to see what you need

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.000
and how I can help.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.360
Do you have a representative
who can give me more details?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.220
Gu!

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:31.100
Gu!

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.150
Gu, come here.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.200
You're good with words.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.000
Talk to him.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.910
Hello.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.810
Here's my business card.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.380
This is Mr. Shen

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.840
is a government official.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.500
I'm here mainly to assist him.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.390
My last name is Gu.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.600
Gentlemen, let's talk inside.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:54.280
No need.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.470
Let's talk right here.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.870
You must be here to solve problems.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.480
So you have to understand the conditions

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.750
in our shantytown.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.080
Since you're already here,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.740
let's talk about it in detail.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.910
Otherwise, how will you know

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.910
the real lives of the common people?

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.390
Cheng Ao,

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.550
please go inside

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.870
and get more details about it from Mr. Gu.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.550
I didn't bring any cigarettes.
I'll go buy a pack.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.610
I'll be right back.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.670
Wait.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.590
I've got cigarettes and a lighter.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.530
He's got cigarettes and a lighter.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.820
I'm not used to this brand.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.990
Director Shen is not used to this brand.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.790
Yes.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.630
Director Shen
lives quite the privileged life.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.790
Let's go, Mr. Gu.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:09.810
Are you stupid?

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:12.660
Yes,

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:13.720
I'm stupid.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.280
Come.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.610
Please come in.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.840
Wait a moment, please.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.390
Cheng.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:34.420
Okay.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.960
Here.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.210
Have a seat.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.530
Are you curious about
why I have so many books,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.120
or do you not understand

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.520
why a laborer would read?

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.550
I am curious.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:15.490
Mr. Cheng,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.690
you just started working
for the government, right?

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.960
Why are you saying this?

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.080
The government officials I've seen

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.390
aren't like you.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.480
To be honest,

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.000
no government official

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.960
has ever come to my place.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.790
You're the first,

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.550
and probably the only one.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.250
I'm not really a government official.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.960
I'm just here to help out.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.730
No wonder.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:41.550
Before I came here,

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.270
I had certain expectations
about the shantytown.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.400
But after experiencing it firsthand,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.620
I realized your suffering

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.580
is far worse than I imagined.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.630
I'm glad to hear that.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.790
So, how do you think these problems
should be solved?

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.150
I have a conscience,

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.080
but I'm not very optimistic

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.790
about this issue.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.960
Indeed.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.550
Most people
are quite pessimistic nowadays.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.040
But the more it's like this,

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.030
the more we need to be optimistic.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:19.600
Mr. Gu,

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.250
you're one of the few.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.320
I'm just...

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.650
an optimist.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.680
Jin.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.780
Have a seat.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.370
I'll stand, Master.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.480
Any news from the young master?

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.490
I heard he's doing business
with some friends from the Northeast.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.600
What kind of business?

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.930
I heard it's a fur trade.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.390
These businessmen from the Northeast

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.650
seem to think highly of the young master.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.060
Send him some money.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.510
Tell him

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.000
not to associate with the Japanese.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.550
Okay,

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.090
I'll pass the message.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.790
What about Ao?

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.730
What's he been up to?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.630
Mr. Shen has been trying to get Ao

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.160
to work for the government.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.670
He went there today.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200
That's good news.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.510
Ao is smart and capable.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.200
He can handle

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.000
working for the government.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.630
Master,

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.720
I heard Miss Lin is building a hospital,

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.380
but she's not using our funds.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.090
Should I ask Ao about this?

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:36.660
No need.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.850
Cheng Ao always knows what he's doing.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.080
Although Miss Lin isn't using our funds,

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.150
as long as her hospital is completed

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.480
and turns a profit,

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.080
her brother
will naturally pay back the money.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.410
He's handling it

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:55.510
very well.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.920
You may go now.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.910
I'll take my leave then, Master.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.820
Sis,

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.730
here's a letter from Yi.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.590
She asked me
to make sure I pass it to you.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.680
Look at it.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.700
Yi's handwriting is so beautiful.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:36.660
It's so elegant.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.750
Do you think

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.000
I'm too useless

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.550
as a mother?

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.150
My child can't even come home.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.530
Yi will blame me, won't she?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.790
Yi won't blame you.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.200
She's a smart kid.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.240
You're right.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.250
As long as she's doing well.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.200
Let's not talk about this anymore.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:10.710
How are you doing?

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.849
Are you still planning
to open the hospital?

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:13.530
Yes.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.240
I'm looking for investors now.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.000
When the hospital is completed,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.329
please come and help out

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400
if you have time.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:22.810
Sure.

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:25.010
As long as you don't mind having me.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.420
I can take on hard work.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.530
Sis, you're an excellent woman.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.690
Be more confident in yourself.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:33.420
Okay.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.880
Mr. Gu, would you mind

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.890
recommending a few books to me?

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.400
Mr. Cheng, what kind of books

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.590
do you usually read?

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.920
When I was in school,

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.750
I read books on law, literature,

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.680
and poetry.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.560
But after graduation,

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.270
I mostly read documents and newspapers.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.880
Then let me recommend some books

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.740
on Western philosophy, history,

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.950
and economics to you.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.590
Great.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:20.640
Thank you.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.850
It's in English?

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:40.940
Well, as an optimistic
and knowledgeable young man,

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.590
how do you view

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.360
the current situation?

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.020
How should I put it?

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.750
I never expect the government

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.000
to solve the problems quickly.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.080
But someone has to raise the issues first.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.280
Looking at human history as a whole,

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.710
there has been progress.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.640
However, this progress
doesn't happen all at once;

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.480
it's

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.050
a step-by-step process.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.320
Sometimes, we may get lost,

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.440
take wrong turns,

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.920
or even go backward.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.360
But those with determination

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.780
will always find the right direction

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.730
and reach the correct goal.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:20.660
That

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.170
is progress.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.320
Let's go.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.330
Let's go out for a walk.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:32.520
Okay.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.790
There's enough for everyone.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.400
Thank you.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.480
Don't worry. There's enough for everyone.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.270
Thank you.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:45.870
Thanks.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:47.260
We made it, Ao.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.260
Thank you.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:05.880
Are you all upset

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.810
because your houses burned down?

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.160
It's okay.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.160
I'll set aside

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.800
part of my monthly earnings

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.520
to help you build new houses.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.550
Then you'll be able to live comfortably,

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:20.640
happily,

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.710
with enough to eat and warm clothes.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.240
Don't be sad anymore, okay?

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.810
Are you handing out money?

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.350
My buddy Cheng Ao
really knows how to get things done.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.240
Look, everyone's face

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.880
is glowing with happiness.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.250
Mr. Gu,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.920
the brother I brought today

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.270
has really helped a lot.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.400
Wouldn't you agree?

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.780
Mr. Cheng,

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.480
thank you.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.750
It's the least I could do.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:50.830
The bag.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:52.420
Your bag.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.710
This is...

00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.450
my money?

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.840
I left home in a hurry
and forgot to bring money.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.140
You really know how to get things done.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.590
Where did you find my bag?

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.450
I don't know.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.400
I found it in the car.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:15.370
Thanks.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.130
We'll be going then.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.130
Hold on to it.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.960
Everyone, get some rest early.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.310
Let's go.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.790
You still have money?

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.390
Want to give some more to everyone?

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.480
I'll bring it myself another day.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.740
No need for you to go through the trouble.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.110
Why are you so quiet, Shen Yiqun?

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.400
Lawyer Cheng, please stop asking.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.400
It was my fault for not keeping
a better eye on Director Shen's bag today.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.440
Huang, that's where you are wrong.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.850
How could Director Shen blame you?

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.330
Our Director Shen is generous.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.130
He puts people first
and loves to help others.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.840
This little bit of money
means nothing to him.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.570
Lawyer Cheng is right.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.200
Thank you, Huang.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:19.780
Come to my office later.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.000
Cheng Ao,

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.130
I really didn't misjudge you.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:34.640
Your way of doing things
is unconventional,

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.590
but the results are always successful.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.200
Come join our department quickly.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.000
We'll team up and work together.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.160
With Huang by your side,

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.300
you're good to go.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.920
Who is it?

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.310
Miss Lin, it's me.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:06.850
Cheng?

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:08.730
Why are you here?

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.680
Well, our boss

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.000
called your house, but no one answered,

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.000
so he sent me to tell you something.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.030
What is it?

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.400
He wants to know

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.960
if you can take a leave
from the hospital tomorrow.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.690
He wants to take you somewhere.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.590
Where to?

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.550
He didn't say,

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.380
but he mentioned you should bring

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.380
your medical tools and medical kit.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.240
Okay, the time works for me.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:33.790
Well,

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.510
I'll call him back later.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.440
Alright. I'll be going then.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:38.200
Okay.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:38.810
Goodbye.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:52.440
Miss Lin! Miss Lin!

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.370
Please stop moving them, will you?

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:55.480
Please stop.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.110
Why?

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:57.830
You don't need to ask why.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:59.440
Look, your forehead is covered in sweat.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.680
You are sweating, right?

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.400
We've got so many brothers here.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.100
-We can handle this ourselves, alright?
-It's okay.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:03.900
I'm not tired.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.000
This is Mr. Gu.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.310
This is Miss Lin.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.000
Miss Lin is a gynecologist.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:28.030
She has basic medical knowledge.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.770
She can help examine everyone

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:31.690
and check your health condition.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.820
Nice to meet you, Miss Lin.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.160
Nice to meet you, Mr. Gu.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.270
To be honest,

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.640
we do have a woman here
who just gave birth

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.110
and has a persistent high fever.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.640
Could you please take a look at her?

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.070
Sure.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.550
Liu.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.510
Take Dr. Lin to see Juan.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:46.350
Sure.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:48.160
This way, please.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:48.720
Let's go.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.070
Mr. Cheng.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.200
Excuse me, Mr. Gu.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:54.750
Cheng.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.120
Ao.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.780
You're quite strong, huh?

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:58.750
Well, I was just...

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.750
Skip lunch today.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.670
Carry a couple more bags. Go.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:03.110
What?

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.830
Go now.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.350
Mr. Cheng, thank you.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.240
With all this rice and flour,

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.090
you've really helped us a lot.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.280
I'm just doing what I can.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.250
I know the situation here,

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.840
but I don't know
how many of these shantytowns

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.030
there are in Shanghai

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:21.350
or in all of China,

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.270
and how much I can help

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.400
or for how long.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.790
Any act of kindness is precious.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.130
I understand what you're saying.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.470
For impoverished communities,

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:35.210
there should be
a complete social security system.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.880
That's something you government officials

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.010
need to work hard on.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:39.120
No.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.550
You're not a government official.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:42.950
You're just helping out.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:44.350
Mr. Gu, do you think

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.320
I'm cut out to be an official?

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.160
I don't care if you become
an official or not in the future.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.070
I just hope you keep doing

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.980
what you're doing now.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.880
If even people with a conscience
don't act,

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.880
then our country has no hope.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:10.200
Your wife's infection was caused

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.200
by the midwife
not properly sterilizing her hands

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.060
and scissors during childbirth.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.610
I don't have enough medicine with me now.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.160
I'll apply some medication first.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.000
You can bring her to Zhongde Hospital
tomorrow,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.210
and I'll change her dressing then.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.810
We need to go to the hospital?

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.970
She's been like this for a week.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.260
If this continues,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.330
your wife's life will be in danger.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.200
Going to the hospital
costs a lot of money, right?

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.030
Don't worry.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.520
I don't charge patients

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.720
from the shantytown.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.970
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.210
Come in.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.160
What's wrong?

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.070
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.920
Are all these your children?

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.680
Yes.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.590
How many kids have you had?

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:55.240
10.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.400
4 survived.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:57.780
How old are you?

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.000
27.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.790
How old were you
when you had your first child?

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.720
14.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:04.860
Doctor,

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.840
I think I'm pregnant again.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:09.910
Have you checked?

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:10.830
I've been pregnant ten times.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.890
I have experience.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.520
It hasn't been long
since you had this child, has it?

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.580
It's been 3 months.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.750
This is very dangerous for you.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.310
It could easily cause uterine rupture.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.160
So, doctor,

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.750
I want to ask

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.570
if you can help me with an abortion.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.000
The government regulations state

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.460
that abortion is illegal.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.240
Doctor, please help me.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.000
In this big fire,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
we lost everything.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.030
I'm pregnant now,

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.070
and my milk supply isn't good.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.350
If I don't go out to work,

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.790
my children will die.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.240
Tomorrow, I'll bring you

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.730
some formula and glucose.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.960
From now on, I'll be responsible

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.440
for your children's food.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.500
Thank you, doctor.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.040
Also...

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.240
Tired?

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.590
You're very kind.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.350
So are you.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.780
We're the same.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.430
That's why we can be friends.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:22.160
Friends?

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.300
Aren't we friends?

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.720
Then what are we?

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.750
What relationship besides friendship

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.070
would allow you

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.030
to be driven home in my car?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.800
Do a lot of girls like you?

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:00.630
I don't know.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.410
It doesn't matter.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.330
I only care about the person I like.

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:08.670
What about you?

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:16.790
Same here.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:38.990
What?

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.400
You didn't see me?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.130
What a coincidence.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.720
You two arrived at the same time.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.520
It's not that.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.070
We came together.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.930
Cheng Ao drove to my place to pick me up.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.400
Next time, I'll pick you up.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.240
His car is no good.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.370
It's too old, uncomfortable to sit in.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.260
She hasn't sat on the back of a bike
for a long time.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.590
Do I only have a bicycle?

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:08.790
Siyun,

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.070
I heard from Aunt Nan

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.300
that you're looking to meet some people

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.880
who can invest in your hospital.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.030
I can introduce someone to you.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.110
You know him.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.240
He has influence in many of the big banks

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.110
in Shanghai.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.020
It's that Under-Secretary Dong.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.790
I've met him.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.000
Yes, you have.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.230
Is he reliable?

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.320
Absolutely.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.110
Not only does he have
strength and influence,

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.570
but also an excellent character.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:30.890
He's very respected

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.680
in our government units.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.680
Go find him. I just saw him.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.930
He's on the second floor.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.130
Just mention my name.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:38.240
Okay.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:38.830
Go ahead.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.880
Cheng Ao.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.040
This is great.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:49.880
From now on, we'll divide the work.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.200
You handle picking up

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:53.510
and dropping off Siyun,

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:54.510
and I'll help her

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.040
with work-related issues.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.880
You think you are quite something,
aren't you?

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.780
Don't block the doorway.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.960
I wouldn't say I'm anything special.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.760
We just each have our strengths.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.030
Miss Lin,

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.510
what are you doing here?

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:10.840
Under-Secretary Dong?

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.510
Hello.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.350
Hello.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.200
Miss Lin,

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.590
how is the progress with the hospital?

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:16.720
Didn't we agree

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.030
that you'd invite me
to the opening ceremony?

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.890
I've run into some difficulties.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:21.590
Difficulties?

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.680
What kind of difficulties?

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.410
Just tell me.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:24.480
If I can help,

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.400
I'll do my best.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:29.200
I've already found the doctors, nurses,

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:30.350
and the location.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.880
I just need the investment.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.360
I've visited a few banks,

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.680
but they've all rejected me
with various excuses.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.440
I know

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.120
you're a shareholder
in several major banks.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.630
If you're willing to help me

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.890
by making a connection with these banks,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.640
that would be a huge help.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.030
You could also invest yourself,
if you'd like.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:49.070
I see.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.310
How about

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.570
we find a place

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:53.010
to discuss this over tea?

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:53.790
Sure.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:54.620
After you.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:58.930
Ao,

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.910
I heard from Jin

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.860
that you've been working
for the government lately.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:05.680
Yes.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:07.600
A few days ago, Shen Yiqun took me

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.070
to visit the shantytown.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.230
I saw that the place

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.440
was really uninhabitable at the moment,

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.100
so I just offered a bit of help.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.640
Father, if you have time,
you should go take a look.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.720
I think they need

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.310
philanthropists like you

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:22.110
over there.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.170
Great.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:28.350
Young people

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.920
should have ideals and ambitions.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.270
Alright.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.250
Find some time
to take me there and have a look.

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.210
Alright. That's wonderful.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.240
Sir,

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:42.520
here's your tea.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.200
Your tea.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.750
Enjoy.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:48.900
Wait.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.470
Sir, you look very familiar.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:00.590
Have we met somewhere before?

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:04.880
Father, are you mistaking him
for someone else?

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.400
Sir, you must have mistaken me
for someone else.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.070
May I...

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.070
know your name?

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.090
My name is He Yaozu.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:18.530
In the 16th year of the Republic of China,

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.240
I met a young man in Nanjing.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.730
His name was Luo Yinghan.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.440
He was a student leader

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:27.480
with strong organizational skills

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.230
whose speeches

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.640
were very inspiring.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:33.880
He looks a lot like you.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.200
Sir, I think you must have mistaken me
for someone else.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.200
I'm from Jiangxi.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.750
I've never been to Nanjing,
nor have I ever been educated.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.070
I'm just an ordinary waiter.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:45.560
Nice to meet you.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.450
Nice to meet you too.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.240
It seems I really have mistaken you
for someone else.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.110
However,

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.030
Mr. He, if you have the chance

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.750
to meet Luo Yinghan in the future,

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.880
please tell him

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.219
that I admire his talents

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.239
and respect his character.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.800
If possible,

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.030
I could

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.679
help him find a very good job

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.560
with a high salary.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.130
Alright, if I get the chance,

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.940
I will definitely pass on the message.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.670
Thank you.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.880
Enjoy, sir.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:42.880
Miss Lin,

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.280
I can help you establish this hospital.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.540
But what's in it for me?

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.060
You can become a shareholder
in the hospital.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.460
We can work together
to ensure its success.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.670
I'm not interested in running a hospital.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:55.880
Then what do you want?

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.890
I didn't mistake him for someone else.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.250
I just don't understand

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:10.400
why he's here.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:12.280
Father,

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.280
you're talking about...

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:16.230
The waiter

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.710
who just claimed to be He Yaozu.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.710
He disguised himself well.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.010
However,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.880
he can't fool me.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.780
I served in the army
during the Qing Dynasty,

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.380
and I've fired foreign guns.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.410
In the Republic of China,

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:33.220
I followed General Wu

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.820
and led over 1,000 soldiers.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.560
Just now, when I shook his hand,

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.540
I could feel that his hand
had been holding guns for years.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.670
So,

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.400
what exactly does he do?

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.920
He's a Communist Party member.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.990
No matter what he calls himself.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:00.920
Father,

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.310
we can't carelessly label someone

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:05.540
as a Communist.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.510
He was that student leader from back then—

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.190
leading street marches,
petitions, and protests—

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.960
very active.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.000
He really does have organizational skills.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.810
In the 16th year of the Republic of China,

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.360
Chiang Kai-shek launched
the anti-Communist purge.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.290
He was arrested.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.360
I thought he must have died young

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.250
and was sorry about it
for quite some time.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.640
I didn't expect he'd actually survive.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.490
He must have suffered a lot.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.440
Father, what did you mean

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.630
when you said

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.170
you'd find him a job?

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.440
I meant it sincerely.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.800
He truly is very capable.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.320
If he can be of use to us,

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.050
that would be great.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.550
But if not—

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.000
remember,

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:55.840
we must never offend someone like him.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:58.290
We're living in chaotic times.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.840
To survive and thrive,

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.940
we absolutely cannot afford
to offend capable people,

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.960
no matter which party

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.820
they belong to.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:09.360
Understood.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.510
Mr. Zeng.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.220
Director Shen.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.360
Cheng Ao was just talking about you.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.440
Thank you for giving him the opportunity

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.190
to contribute
to the victims of the disaster.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.800
Mr. Zeng,

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.480
Cheng Ao is a very resourceful person.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.440
If it weren't for him,

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.620
the issues in the shantytown

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.550
wouldn't have been resolved so smoothly.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:29.750
Let me introduce you.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.670
This is my cousin, Major Zheng.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:33.330
He now works for Commander Ji.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.840
Major Zheng, it's a pleasure to meet you.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.760
Nice to meet you.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.630
Nice to meet you.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.170
Major Zheng, are you here

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.280
on official business
or is it something personal?

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.280
I came here with my commander.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.160
What a promising young man.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:51.000
Alright, you guys go ahead and talk.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.860
I, as an old man, won't interrupt.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:03.590
Commander Ji will be here soon.

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:04.590
I'll go pick him up.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:05.120
Go ahead.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.910
Have you been busy with work lately?

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:17.940
Not really.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:19.220
Such a big event—

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.740
even your father attended.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.360
He is

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.820
your cousin's commander?

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.440
Yes.

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.320
This man
has a mysterious and complex background.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.070
He was once
a senior Communist Party member

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.920
but later defected to the Kuomintang.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.730
I heard that in recent years,

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:36.880
the Chairman set up a secret organization

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.410
targeting the Communists,

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.040
and he's one of the leaders.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.190
Just last month,

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:42.910
more than 20 Communists

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:45.070
were caught by their organization.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.270
The Communist Party hates him to death.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:49.960
He's a turncoat.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.300
If the Japanese give him some benefit,

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:54.740
he'll become a traitor.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.170
You think he doesn't know

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:58.570
what kind of person he is?

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.670
A person either never betrays
or betrays countless times.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:03.470
No one will ever truly trust him.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.190
His life isn't easy.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.110
The Communist "Dog Beating Squad"
has been keeping a close eye on him.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.840
He rarely shows up

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.370
at public events like this.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:12.410
See? He even

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.960
brought two people with him here today.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.000
Dog Beating Squad?

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:20.410
You don't know it?

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.090
It's an organization the Communist Party

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.650
set up to root out traitors.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.590
His name is definitely high

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:29.550
on their list.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.520
They're watching him this closely,

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.920
so why does he still dare to show up?

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.190
The fact that he shows up

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:38.800
means there's something attracting him.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:40.760
Let me test you.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.700
What do you think it is?

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.380
Look at that clueless expression of yours.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:49.710
Power

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:50.800
and women.

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:54.480
Then isn't he just like you?

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.590
Shut up.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.080
I heard what you two were saying.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.500
When did you learn to eavesdrop?

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.590
Dad told you

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:06.770
not to talk about politics in public.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.400
I wasn't.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.460
I was teaching him.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.480
Nonsense.

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:15.480
Does Cheng Ao need you to teach him that?

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.280
Then I'll teach you.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.280
I'll teach you...

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.490
Don't get physical.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.880
It's good
that Lin Siyun didn't come today.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:25.730
She's here.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.170
She's meeting someone
your brother introduced her to.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:33.510
Who did you introduce her to?

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:34.650
Under-Secretary Dong.

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:35.650
That old pervert?

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.340
He's hit on so many girls in our class.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:44.280
You...

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.800
Miss Lin,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.600
I've always admired you.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.110
You're educated, beautiful,

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:51.360
and smart.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:53.950
You should know what I want.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:00.790
Don't go.

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:03.110
We can discuss terms.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:05.090
I can give you a house,

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:05.980
money,

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:07.590
and a life of comfort.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.170
As for the hospital,

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.350
if you're interested,
you can run one for fun.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:12.080
How about it?

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.400
Under-Secretary Dong,

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.460
please step aside.

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:17.110
You're here anyway.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:19.370
You're not a little girl anymore, right?

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:21.890
Miss Lin,

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.670
I like you. Let's just have some fun.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.510
I'm telling you, struggling won't help.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:30.970
What game are you playing?

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:38.800
You dare stab me?

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.000
I'm telling you,

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.000
this isn't over!

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.000
Under-Secretary Dong,

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.020
what happened to you?

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.280
Who did you introduce me to?

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.540
Look what she did to me.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.720
You...

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.090
Don't mind him. He's always like that.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:04.900
Don't stoop to Siyun's level.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:05.440
Please calm down.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.030
I can't calm down. I'm telling you.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.230
As long as I'm around,

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.200
she will never

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.800
be able to open that hospital.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.190
Let's not talk about the hospital now.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.920
She was definitely wrong
to have stabbed you.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.920
I'll make sure to teach her a lesson.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:16.930
How about this?

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.280
I'll take you to the hospital now.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:18.880
Tomorrow,

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.560
I'll visit you at your residence

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.760
with 3 gold bars.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.960
Three gold bars,

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:24.760
and you think that's enough
to deal with me?

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.920
Who do you think I am?

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.860
You've misunderstood me.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:29.190
You're in a high position;

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.840
surely this small gift is nothing.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.840
This is just a token of my sincerity.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.210
Under-Secretary Dong,

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.440
I heard

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:37.840
your son has always wanted
to attend military academy.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.700
How about this?

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.030
Leave it to me,

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.360
and I promise
to arrange everything properly

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.480
so your son can go with honor.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.110
Additionally,

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:45.760
he'll receive

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.630
special attention from his teachers
at the academy.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:48.710
You can make this happen?

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:49.480
Absolutely.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.000
Good.

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:52.240
You said that.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:52.960
Yes.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.550
I'll be expecting you tomorrow night.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:55.190
Alright.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:55.960
Well,

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.190
let me take you to the hospital.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.650
No need. I'll go by myself.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.710
Take care.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:10.800
Are you alright?
