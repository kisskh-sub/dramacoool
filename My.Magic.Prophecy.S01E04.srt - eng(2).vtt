WEBVTT

00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.536
Make yourself comfortable.

00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:03.540
One more thing, keep away from my stuff.

00:00:04.568 --> 00:00:05.832
I’m back.

00:00:05.864 --> 00:00:06.680
Ouch!

00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:08.680
Why is the bathroom floor soaking wet?!

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:10.568
It’s called a bathroom for a reason!

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.960
You think you’re on a holiday trip?

00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:14.940
I was just here. Don’t overreact.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.024
Let’s lay down some ground rules.

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:18.104
Before one of us ends up killing the other.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.600
Hey, what are you doing?

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.584
The chair’s broken, so I’m fixing it.

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:26.928
I told you not to mess with my stuff.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.768
Do you think it’s easy to be back here?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.160
That chair.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.024
Can you fix it back the way it was?

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.640
What’s the matter?

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.968
I’m freaking bored.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.696
Didn’t you say you liked nature,

00:01:07.728 --> 00:01:09.984
nice weather, and sleeping without aircon?

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:12.864
Hm?

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.120
In, In.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.088
Can I borrow your phone?

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.160
I need to order shoes.

00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:25.368
Today’s the last day to pre-order this pair.

00:01:25.392 --> 00:01:25.744
No.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.256
Come on, don’t be stingy.

00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:29.984
Just one pair of shoes.

00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:32.896
I haven’t shopped or gone anywhere since I got here.

00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:34.136
Just one pair.

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:35.416
No means no.

00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:36.768
You’re not allowed to use phones.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.968
I’m begging you.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.590
Please.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.560
Let me, alright?

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.400
If I don’t get them today, they’re out forever.

00:01:55.432 --> 00:01:56.432
Please?

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.016
You’re begging me?

00:01:58.032 --> 00:01:58.632
Yes.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.930
No.

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:05.560
Come here!

00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:07.664
- Wait. What are you doing? - Hand over your phone!

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.576
- What are you doing? - Give me the phone!

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:10.608
No.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.376
You can’t.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.380
In!

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.968
In!

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.968
Look. A child ghost is calling you.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.040
Child ghost, my ass.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.420
Get a grip.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.760
You need to hide.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.136
Don’t even think of showing your face.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.460
Got it?

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.020
Fine.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.640
In!

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.840
In!

00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:39.824
I’m coming.

00:02:39.832 --> 00:02:41.440
Hey!

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.440
Damn you.

00:02:43.464 --> 00:02:44.464
Just go.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.336
In!

00:02:46.368 --> 00:02:47.656
Hi, there.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.104
Look at you.

00:02:54.448 --> 00:02:56.170
You’ve grown so much.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.360
I can barely carry you now.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.456
I missed you the most in the whole world.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.184
I missed you the most too.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.120
If you missed me, why didn’t you come see me?

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.576
I’ve been busy. That’s why.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.952
But I’m coming to visit you at home today.

00:03:15.984 --> 00:03:16.896
Okay?

00:03:16.944 --> 00:03:18.544
Yay!

00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:20.376
Yay!

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.984
Ghost!

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.152
Khaohom,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.144
he’s human.

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.312
Not a ghost.

00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:32.416
Look.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.744
You can touch him.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.740
Try it.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.824
Can you touch him first, just to be sure?

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.936
You want me to touch him?

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.176
See?

00:04:01.368 --> 00:04:02.520
He’s tangible.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.584
See, Khaohom?

00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:32.832
Look. You can touch him too.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.424
You believe him now?

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.568
I do.

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:45.824
There’s no way a ghost could be this insanely handsome.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.000
So you brought a friend named…

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.200
I’m Thap.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.584
My name is Thapfah.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.624
Wow, that’s such a beautiful name.

00:05:05.664 --> 00:05:09.568
Would you like to have dinner at my house?

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.408
Of course. I promise I’ll be there.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.008
Yay!

00:05:23.848 --> 00:05:25.768
- Bye. - Bye.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.776
Hey, you understand the northern dialect?

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.544
I went to med school in Chiang Mai.

00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:37.136
Yeah? Can you speak it?

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.780
No.

00:05:38.888 --> 00:05:40.640
Oh, I’m sorry, sir.

00:05:40.752 --> 00:05:44.248
I was just there for school.

00:05:44.288 --> 00:05:45.816
I didn’t grow up there.

00:05:46.376 --> 00:05:46.856
What about you?

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.960
How come you understand it?

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.200
Hey, this is my home too, you know.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.472
Can you speak it?

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.380
It’s hot.

00:05:58.688 --> 00:05:59.960
I’d better head inside.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
In.

00:06:05.712 --> 00:06:07.710
Let me join you for dinner at Khaohom’s?

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.330
Sure.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.990
On a few conditions.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.072
If you want to come,

00:06:17.112 --> 00:06:18.712
we need to get a few things straight first.

00:06:18.736 --> 00:06:20.360
Sure. Fire away.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.936
First, don’t tell anyone why you’re here.

00:06:25.984 --> 00:06:26.944
Easy peasy.

00:06:26.976 --> 00:06:28.208
Don’t bark.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.736
I mean… watch what you’re saying.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.090
I’ll try.

00:06:37.456 --> 00:06:38.616
Okay, okay.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.920
Anything else?

00:06:39.952 --> 00:06:41.448
Don’t tell people you’re a doctor.

00:06:41.488 --> 00:06:42.896
What if they ask?

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.480
How about a fortune teller?

00:06:47.512 --> 00:06:49.480
No way.

00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:50.792
Absolutely not.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.280
What’s your problem with fortune tellers?

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.600
Too many bad experiences.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.270
Like?

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.088
My parents got scammed by one. Almost lost everything.

00:07:04.136 --> 00:07:05.960
And when they finally recovered,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.048
I thought my mom’d give it up.

00:07:07.072 --> 00:07:09.640
Nope. Right back to her fortune-teller obsession.

00:07:09.672 --> 00:07:11.128
She asks them about everything,

00:07:11.168 --> 00:07:13.168
especially family members’ health.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.936
Even though her own son is a doctor?

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960
Mm.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.856
To Mrs. Thepee, having a doctor son is just a way to brag to her friends.

00:07:20.392 --> 00:07:22.992
She depends on me for the street cred.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.584
Mhm. Let’s get going.

00:07:30.072 --> 00:07:32.920
Finally! I get to leave the house.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.312
And it wasn’t just fortune tellers.

00:09:08.352 --> 00:09:10.446
I had to deal with all kinds of superstitious “gurus.”

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.470
Like what?

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.048
Shamans.

00:09:13.088 --> 00:09:13.800
What?

00:09:13.832 --> 00:09:14.688
True.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.032
Back when I was an intern,

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.680
there was a patient with herpes zoster.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.400
Rather than seeing a doctor,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.600
they went straight to a shaman.

00:09:21.624 --> 00:09:23.464
The shaman blew on the rash and made it worse.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.448
Some people even refused to pay for medical treatment.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.624
Instead, they spent money tearing down their house

00:09:30.648 --> 00:09:33.104
because a fortune teller told them the land belonged to a spirit.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.288
They believed the spirit got angry and made them sick.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.300
How’s that?

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.752
I know you’re not a believer

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.096
but you can’t bring that attitude here.

00:09:43.136 --> 00:09:45.456
Besides, you’re hiding out for your life.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.928
Don’t even think to change anyone’s way of thinking.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.576
Whatever they say, go with the flow.

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:52.624
Don’t show off.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:53.970
Understood?

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.096
What if the villagers’ beliefs are wrong?

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.640
Then go find a new sanctuary.

00:10:02.664 --> 00:10:03.792
Pick your battles.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.630
Jeez.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.192
He’s an older friend of mine.

00:10:21.216 --> 00:10:22.048
His name’s Thap.

00:10:22.096 --> 00:10:23.992
I see.

00:10:24.016 --> 00:10:24.960
Hello.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.456
- Hi. - Hello there.

00:10:26.488 --> 00:10:28.328
No wonder you rushed home the other day.

00:10:28.368 --> 00:10:30.208
You brought someone here with you.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.472
He’s an athlete who got injured.

00:10:35.504 --> 00:10:38.192
He’s in recovery, so I brought him here.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.856
So what sport do you play?

00:10:42.904 --> 00:10:43.944
- Badminton. - Basketball.

00:10:43.968 --> 00:10:45.080
What?

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.968
It’s basketball.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.624
- Basketball. - Is that so?

00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:51.440
That’s great.

00:10:51.488 --> 00:10:53.440
The kids here love football.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.568
But they’re interested in basketball too.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.480
If you have time, come teach them.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.960
They’d be thrilled.

00:11:00.024 --> 00:11:02.376
I’d be happy to.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.200
It’s a small village.

00:11:12.232 --> 00:11:14.616
When a newcomer shows up,

00:11:14.656 --> 00:11:16.816
everyone gets excited.

00:11:16.872 --> 00:11:18.672
In!

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.568
In!

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.992
Khaohom.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.144
Hi, In.

00:11:25.168 --> 00:11:26.096
Hi.

00:11:26.128 --> 00:11:27.552
Hi, guys.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.008
I’ve brought you all something.

00:11:31.056 --> 00:11:32.520
Wow!

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.600
Hey, I’ll be right back.

00:11:38.248 --> 00:11:40.250
Let’s go. Come on.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.944
Let’s go over there.

00:11:41.952 --> 00:11:43.168
Come.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.072
Who wants to play football?

00:11:45.088 --> 00:11:46.192
Very lively.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.576
Who wants this basketball?

00:11:48.616 --> 00:11:49.312
Who wants it?

00:11:49.344 --> 00:11:50.536
I want a water gun.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.672
Water gun? Let me get it.

00:11:52.704 --> 00:11:53.720
Water gun too.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.440
You too? Okay.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.904
He’s the villagers’ favorite.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.648
Is that so?

00:11:59.672 --> 00:12:00.672
Yes.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.648
The kids love In.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.824
Every time he visits, he always brings tons of stuff.

00:12:05.856 --> 00:12:10.928
Toys, gifts, and school supplies.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.352
And for those who can’t afford to study,

00:12:14.376 --> 00:12:16.432
In pays their tuition so they can keep going.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.704
Back in the day, In’s parents were the ones helping out.

00:12:20.728 --> 00:12:22.160
But since they passed away,

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.160
In has taken over.

00:12:27.184 --> 00:12:28.568
Is this In’s hometown?

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.720
No, they started out as travelers.

00:12:31.744 --> 00:12:33.272
But they came here often,

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.448
and everyone in their family is wonderful.

00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:37.928
So the locals really welcome them.

00:12:39.816 --> 00:12:41.820
They loved it here so much.

00:12:41.856 --> 00:12:44.856
They even bought land and built the Starry House over there.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.256
The house I’m staying in?

00:12:46.296 --> 00:12:47.296
Mhm.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:53.288
But ever since his parents died in a car accident five years ago,

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.024
In has come here every year to make merit for them.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.600
He never lets anyone see how sad he is.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.320
Poor him.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.180
Catch!

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.600
Well, well.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.000
Want a drink?

00:13:24.032 --> 00:13:26.000
No, sir.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.904
This jar is a welcome drink.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.480
Only good and rare stuff inside.

00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:33.928
Really?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.024
Yep, it’s specially made to welcome relatives and important guests.

00:13:38.048 --> 00:13:39.048
I see.

00:13:46.808 --> 00:13:48.810
If you’re so bored, why don’t you read?

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.568
You brought lots of books.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.800
I’ll keep you company.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Ow.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.664
Start reading.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.200
Guess that comic book is super fun.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.328
Good morning, In.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.464
What do we have here? Looks delicious.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.600
Uncle Ju brought it this morning.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.600
Can you eat this kind of food?

00:16:27.728 --> 00:16:29.544
Of course. No problem at all.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.024
Hey, I’m handling the food offerings for your merit-making.

00:16:37.048 --> 00:16:38.248
I already told Auntie Pian.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.824
Will it even be edible?

00:16:42.912 --> 00:16:44.910
Is it a sin if the monks get food poisoning?

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.096
I’m afraid my good wishes won’t reach my parents.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.088
Fine. Just say what you have in mind.

00:16:50.128 --> 00:16:51.560
Um…

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.592
I already ordered a chili dip set and dessert.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.416
For the main food, I’m thinking…

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.728
Clear soup with tofu and minced pork,

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.152
and stir-fried vermicelli.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.184
No problem. We’ll hit the market today.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.592
You want to help or go to the market?

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.680
You’re being nice to me.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.384
Did the chief and Auntie Pian

00:17:20.408 --> 00:17:21.408
say anything to you?

00:17:23.112 --> 00:17:24.712
Don’t pity me.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.184
What?

00:17:26.208 --> 00:17:27.544
Pity?

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.384
Do you think you’re so pitiable?

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.728
Finish it all and do the dishes.

00:17:59.024 --> 00:18:00.024
Thank you.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.664
So Tara didn’t come to get her own medicine?

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.816
Kasidis picked up the latest prescription.

00:18:11.848 --> 00:18:14.776
I also checked with Keng, Mrs. Tara’s doctor.

00:18:14.816 --> 00:18:16.456
He said his prescription hasn’t changed.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.616
What must have changed is the medication label.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.920
So now we can be sure, right?

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.888
Well done, Doctor.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.936
Will you two stop flirting?

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.540
Flirting, my foot.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.616
If Mrs. Tara wakes up,

00:18:36.832 --> 00:18:38.830
she’ll be the key witness.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.120
I just hope she tells the truth

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.248
if she wakes up.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.696
Oh, hey, do you drink?

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.720
I saw you talking about the herbal booze.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.992
Of course.

00:19:05.016 --> 00:19:06.784
Everyone does.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.912
- Yeah? - Mhm.

00:19:08.952 --> 00:19:09.936
I thought you didn’t drink

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.960
because you’re a doctor.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.488
That’s what people expect.

00:19:14.536 --> 00:19:15.848
That’s why I don’t drink often.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.264
Go ahead and drink.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.232
Life is short.

00:19:20.248 --> 00:19:21.560
Do whatever you want

00:19:22.656 --> 00:19:24.660
as long as it doesn’t bother anyone else.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.744
What’s that noise?

00:19:42.792 --> 00:19:44.872
Dear holy elder spirits…

00:19:44.904 --> 00:19:47.520
This child has fallen ill.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.976
Whatever causes the suffering,

00:19:50.008 --> 00:19:52.640
I ask you to cast it out.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.168
The villagers are performing a ritual,

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.216
basically asking the spirits about the illness.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.152
Why don’t they just ask doctors?

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:02.870
Who’s that?

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.336
I’ve never seen him before.

00:20:04.384 --> 00:20:05.384
Right.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.424
Who’s this stranger you brought?

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:13.472
The elder spirits say

00:20:13.496 --> 00:20:15.144
this is because a stranger

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:20.160
brought something bad into our village.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.680
Really?

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.840
Shit, we’re screwed.

00:20:23.872 --> 00:20:26.576
Hey, who are you? Why are you here?

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.960
He’s my friend.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.136
Sorry about him.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.784
The elder spirits are gone.

00:20:37.808 --> 00:20:40.512
I don’t think I can help your child anymore, Pun.

00:20:40.528 --> 00:20:41.552
Shaman.

00:20:41.568 --> 00:20:42.568
Please wait, shaman.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.136
Please come back.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:48.490
Let’s go home.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.592
I shouldn’t have brought you here.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.190
Hold on.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:54.980
Wait.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.936
What’s he doing?

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.984
Excuse me, can I take a look at your baby?

00:21:02.016 --> 00:21:03.016
Are you a doctor?

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.376
No, ma’am.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.896
He’s a fortune teller.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.130
Fortune teller?

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.400
May I?

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.816
How long has this been going on?

00:21:26.856 --> 00:21:28.080
It happens every day,

00:21:28.112 --> 00:21:29.784
especially in the afternoon.

00:21:30.928 --> 00:21:32.120
Every afternoon?

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.160
Yes.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.600
May I help, please?

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.016
The crying’s stopped.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.112
So sacred.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.020
It’s a mother spirit.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.128
Goodness! What should I do?

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.552
Nothing but fight, ma’am.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.880
Right now, your child doesn’t believe you can take care of them.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.544
The way to fix this is simple:

00:22:46.568 --> 00:22:50.504
First, make them feel most comfortable.

00:22:50.528 --> 00:22:53.672
You can play a lullaby softly at home.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:59.544
What you mustn’t do is take your baby to loud places. That will upset them.

00:22:59.584 --> 00:23:05.168
Most importantly, your motherly touch will make the baby feel safe.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.440
Thank you so much.

00:23:07.472 --> 00:23:08.576
Really, thank you.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.296
You’re welcome.

00:23:09.328 --> 00:23:11.536
Hang in there, ma’am.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.552
No mother spirit could ever beat the real mother.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.810
Okay?

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:17.550
Here.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:21.488
Thank you.

00:23:21.512 --> 00:23:22.752
Thank you so much.

00:23:23.128 --> 00:23:25.130
Wow, that’s magical.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.056
By the way, what’s that “mother spirit” you mentioned?

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.920
It’s what they call colic.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.288
That sounds familiar.

00:24:11.048 --> 00:24:13.050
It’s a symptom newborns get.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.400
They cry at the same time and for a long time.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.776
You told me not to oppose the villagers,

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:19.992
so I had to improvise.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:32.744
Walk behind me

00:24:32.784 --> 00:24:34.144
so you won’t have to see anything.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.328
Where’s the shopping list?

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.104
Do you expect people to read your handwriting?

00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.336
I tried my best.

00:25:01.648 --> 00:25:03.650
Doctors will always be doctors.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:06.840
What does this say?

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.300
Ready?

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.608
It’s 20 baht per shirt!

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.544
Who’s that? I don’t think I’ve seen him.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.560
He’s from Bangkok.

00:25:35.592 --> 00:25:36.952
I heard he’s an athlete.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.696
He’s staying in Phu Dao.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.112
An athlete?

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:49.670
Hey.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.736
Let’s go buy the ingredients.

00:25:51.768 --> 00:25:53.928
What’s the rush? Let me check this out first.

00:25:55.096 --> 00:25:56.952
- Mom! - Someone’s fainting!

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.768
- What happened? - Someone fainted!

00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.464
Mom!

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.560
Somebody, help!

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.144
Mom!

00:26:01.152 --> 00:26:02.728
Hey, wait.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.616
Mom, what’s happening to you?

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:06.968
Mom!

00:26:07.008 --> 00:26:08.088
Get out of the way, please.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.576
Call an ambulance now.

00:26:09.784 --> 00:26:10.792
Hello. Someone’s just fainted.

00:26:10.816 --> 00:26:11.976
Record a video of your mom.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.976
Looks like she’s possessed.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:17.544
Spoon!

00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:18.744
Someone put a spoon in her mouth!

00:26:18.768 --> 00:26:20.416
You can’t do that!

00:26:20.456 --> 00:26:21.976
Don’t put anything in her mouth.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.472
Guys, please step back.

00:26:23.512 --> 00:26:24.816
Give her space to breathe.

00:26:24.848 --> 00:26:27.088
Please move. Listen to him.

00:26:27.112 --> 00:26:30.336
He just helped Pun’s baby.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.328
Once the doctor arrives, show them this video.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.416
- Okay? - Yes.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.760
Wow, if I didn’t know he’s an athlete,

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.096
I’d swear he’s a doctor.

00:26:48.128 --> 00:26:49.176
Right, guys?

00:26:49.224 --> 00:26:50.376
He’s amazing.

00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:52.536
Exactly.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.888
He’s really smart.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.952
He’s amazing.

00:26:54.976 --> 00:26:56.280
He’s really smart.

00:26:56.312 --> 00:26:56.808
Let’s go.

00:26:56.848 --> 00:26:57.840
Thank you so much.

00:26:57.864 --> 00:26:59.712
Thank you so much.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:04.592
Don’t go just yet.

00:27:06.304 --> 00:27:08.300
Here, take some vegetables.

00:27:08.712 --> 00:27:10.710
They’re for you.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.980
Thank you.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.816
We really appreciate your help.

00:27:17.832 --> 00:27:19.272
You’re so good.

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:21.270
Hey, we have to go now.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.464
Thank you so much.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.664
Thank you for this.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.792
He’s so good.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.136
Very good.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.460
In.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.520
In, what’s wrong? Talk to me.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.024
Do whatever you want.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:58.792
I won’t stop you anymore.

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:01.790
Come on, In.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.464
Someone was sick right in front of me.

00:28:03.488 --> 00:28:04.896
How could I not help?

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.632
Yeah, go ahead.

00:28:08.664 --> 00:28:10.584
I already told you you can do whatever you want.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.960
In.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.744
Don’t be like this.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.144
If whoever’s after you finds out where you are and comes for you,

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.352
and if something happens to you, what am I supposed to tell Dao?

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.700
You care.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.520
You could’ve just said so.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.400
Look.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:52.776
How would they even find me here?

00:28:53.976 --> 00:28:56.680
I came here because of your dream, didn’t I?

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.440
And it already passed.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.320
I just had another one.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.584
In my dream, you were here.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.448
And I don’t know if I can save you in time.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.752
Hey, In!

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:29.630
In.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.232
Take a deep breath.

00:29:33.256 --> 00:29:34.256
Deep breath.

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:41.192
Can you tell me what you saw in that dream?

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.280
You were lying there, covered in blood.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.776
A crowd had gathered around you.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:55.950
Here?

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.216
How long have you had visions like that?

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.576
Just tell me. I want to know.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.580
Since I was a kid.

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.544
I guess I got it from my mom.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.224
She saw them too.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.224
And you faint like that every time?

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.584
Depends on how strong the vision is.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.168
If I just see it and stay out of it, I’m fine.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.152
But if I warn them, it hits me hard.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.540
Why?

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.976
We’re not supposed to interfere with other people’s fates.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.896
It’s like a flying arrow.

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:59.344
If it’s aimed at you and you dodge it,

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.424
it’ll still land on someone else.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.872
No one can really change their fate.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:07.912
By warning you,

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.864
it’s like I’m taking the arrow for you.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.272
Then don’t help me.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.888
I already did.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.776
In, I just don’t get it.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.400
Why are you doing this?

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.280
I’ve been wondering ever since you helped me at the hospital.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.752
The last people I dreamed about and couldn’t save were my mom and dad.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.120
It still haunts me to this day.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.776
But they were your parents.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.776
I’m nobody to you.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:00.640
You’re your parents’ son,

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.552
Dao’s brother,

00:32:04.664 --> 00:32:06.660
an important member of your family.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.920
What about you?

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.352
I’m all alone.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.400
It makes no difference whether I’m alive or dead.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.496
Then tell me your symptoms when you try to warn someone.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.000
So next time it happens, I’ll be able to help.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:47.856
At least right now, you’re not alone.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.576
When our eyes lose their sparks

00:32:59.624 --> 00:33:01.152
You don’t have to talk about your parents.

00:33:01.168 --> 00:33:02.656
When daylight fades to dark

00:33:02.688 --> 00:33:06.000
You can start with the first time you dreamed about me.

00:33:06.048 --> 00:33:10.352
Hard times come when we’re unprepared

00:33:10.376 --> 00:33:13.720
But if our love stays true

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.160
Whatever the hardship, We’ll make it through

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:23.632
Though we’re apart, My heart stays close to you

00:33:23.664 --> 00:33:30.656
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

00:33:30.688 --> 00:33:37.192
Don’t give up your life for me That’s never my creed

00:33:37.232 --> 00:33:45.136
Having you close Is beyond a dream come true

00:33:45.168 --> 00:33:48.584
No matter how far we drift apart

00:33:48.608 --> 00:33:52.232
We’ll always find a way to restart

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:57.864
Because in this world, There’s only one you

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:04.704
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

00:34:04.728 --> 00:34:12.456
Being by my side each day is all I need

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.528
Good morning, In.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.768
I set aside some of the food for you,

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:41.944
so you’d know how good it is.

00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:46.184
You should let someone else be the judge of that, Thap.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.170
Seriously?

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.720
Go ahead and eat first while it’s still hot.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.920
I’ll join you in a sec.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.260
Mm.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.304
Say it, Mr. Inthu.

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:31.590
It’s good.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:33.968
What was that?

00:35:34.008 --> 00:35:35.392
It’s good, alright?

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.736
Pour the water of dedication.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.976
Is it difficult living here?

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.504
Not at all, Venerable Grandfather.

00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:08.736
In can be a little stubborn.

00:36:08.784 --> 00:36:10.472
Don’t take it personally.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.824
He’s just been on his own for a long time.

00:36:12.848 --> 00:36:13.896
Venerable Grandfather,

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.352
In wasn’t like this before?

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:21.120
Back then, he was full of spirit.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.008
But after he lost his parents,

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.552
he grew quiet and withdrawn.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.040
His house here was left abandoned.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:34.456
Village Chief Ju and the villagers have been looking after it for him.

00:36:34.784 --> 00:36:36.780
Otherwise, it’d be a wreck.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.472
Like the flower garden up there.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.960
There’s a flower garden?

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:46.768
His father planted it for his wife

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.288
and son when In was born.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.568
And what about his ability to see people’s futures?

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.080
That’s something else entirely.

00:36:56.512 --> 00:36:58.510
In doesn’t want to see them,

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.520
but fate left him no choice.

00:37:01.576 --> 00:37:05.120
That’s why he keeps to himself and avoids others.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.848
Because when he sees, he wants to help.

00:37:08.888 --> 00:37:11.416
And when he helps, he takes on the consequences.

00:37:17.496 --> 00:37:19.576
Don’t overthink it.

00:37:19.608 --> 00:37:23.528
He helps you because he truly wants to.

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:28.376
Even though he knows he must take the fall instead?

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.392
Have you ever heard that nothing in this world is a coincidence?

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:41.984
You two crossing paths, it was meant to be.

00:37:42.656 --> 00:37:44.660
This misfortune is serious.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:49.488
You must stay calm, be patient,

00:37:49.512 --> 00:37:51.200
and look after each other.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.944
Yes, sir.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.430
THAYAKORN THAMMASIRIKUL, AGE 46 INGORN THAMMASIRIKUL, AGE 45

00:39:24.072 --> 00:39:25.416
TON

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.192
What’s up, Ton?

00:39:31.208 --> 00:39:33.976
Thap, your family’s got to stop shopping online.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.824
You can stop me,

00:39:35.848 --> 00:39:37.648
but good luck stopping Mrs. Thepee.

00:39:37.688 --> 00:39:40.872
But Kasidis put a listening device in the packages.

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.850
He probably knows where you are right now.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.880
Don’t leave the house.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.536
Mae Hong Son is huge,

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.568
and I’m close to having enough evidence.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:53.888
But hey, if anything feels off,

00:39:53.928 --> 00:39:55.608
you might have to come back to Bangkok.

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:13.160
He’s not in Singapore.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.520
How do you not know where he is?

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.192
Find him before he comes back and causes me trouble.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.400
As for her, I’m just going to let her sleep.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.840
As long as she’s out cold, she’s no different from a corpse.

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:27.850
Okay.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.200
In, wake up.

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:39.050
Let’s go to Village Chief Ju’s house.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.680
What’s there?

00:40:40.728 --> 00:40:41.728
You’ll see.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.032
Come on!

00:40:45.056 --> 00:40:46.088
Okay, okay.

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.460
Hurry up.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.368
Come on, have a seat.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.640
Thank you.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.056
Thank you.

00:40:59.104 --> 00:41:00.232
Wow, Auntie Pian.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.672
Thank you.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:11.544
Thap and Khaohom teamed up to surprise In.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.940
Really?

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:21.344
Thap’s amazing.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.672
He hasn’t even been here that long,

00:41:22.696 --> 00:41:24.384
but he’s already helped so many villagers.

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.456
All right, everyone.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.352
Let’s eat!

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.816
Pork belly, yeah?

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.180
Guys, stop!

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:42.170
I’m sorry,

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:49.080
but I don’t think we should use our own chopsticks for raw pork.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.456
We’ve always done it this way.

00:41:52.504 --> 00:41:53.960
We’re all fine.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.768
Still, we shouldn’t.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.744
We didn’t know better before.

00:41:58.768 --> 00:42:00.520
But we do now, right?

00:42:00.592 --> 00:42:06.944
So we should dip our chopsticks in boiling water first. It helps sterilize them.

00:42:08.976 --> 00:42:09.856
Do it!

00:42:09.888 --> 00:42:10.888
Chief, sir.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:13.160
I don’t think that works either.

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.784
What should we do then?

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:20.576
Just listen to him.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:22.512
This young man knows what he’s doing.

00:42:22.544 --> 00:42:25.152
He helped Pun’s kid and Jit at the market.

00:42:25.176 --> 00:42:27.288
That’s right.

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:29.968
So, what should we do?

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.888
We can do this.

00:42:31.928 --> 00:42:38.672
We use a separate set of chopsticks for the raw pork.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:42.432
That works, Auntie Pian.

00:42:42.456 --> 00:42:44.200
It’s very good.

00:42:44.232 --> 00:42:45.112
Great.

00:42:45.136 --> 00:42:47.824
Use serving chopsticks for the raw pork.

00:42:48.176 --> 00:42:50.112
Can I have them too?

00:42:50.136 --> 00:42:51.032
Here we go,

00:42:51.056 --> 00:42:53.030
the serving chopsticks are ready.

00:42:56.704 --> 00:42:58.376
Khaohom, which piece do you want?

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:12.568
You eat barbecue pork too?

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:13.920
Mm.

00:43:15.168 --> 00:43:17.170
What about your good cholesterol?

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.660
Forgot all about it when I left Bangkok.

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:26.360
In, why aren’t you using an honorific when you talk to Thap?

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.832
Exactly.

00:43:28.864 --> 00:43:30.712
I’m wondering the same thing, Khaohom.

00:43:30.728 --> 00:43:31.728
Why?

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.936
It’s not polite, In.

00:43:34.984 --> 00:43:39.240
You’re the one who taught me to use an honorific when speaking to someone older.

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.968
But he’s so old. Can I just call him “Uncle”?

00:43:48.016 --> 00:43:49.216
Yes, you can.

00:43:49.248 --> 00:43:50.368
I can, right?

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:54.760
Uncle Thap, yeah?

00:44:12.696 --> 00:44:14.072
Wanna try some?

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:18.624
You sure it’s a good idea?

00:44:18.648 --> 00:44:21.152
Come on.

00:44:21.192 --> 00:44:22.672
Let’s do some shots.

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:25.944
Cheers!

00:44:32.152 --> 00:44:33.552
Maybe you should stop.

00:44:33.592 --> 00:44:34.776
Cheers!

00:44:36.664 --> 00:44:37.496
Cheers.

00:44:37.512 --> 00:44:38.624
Cheers, Village Chief!

00:44:38.648 --> 00:44:39.968
Bam!

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:45.048
Chief!

00:44:45.088 --> 00:44:45.720
What?

00:44:45.768 --> 00:44:46.928
You about to get knocked out?

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.360
This is a magical medicine.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:56.800
Wherever it hurts, it heals.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:59.416
Hey, don’t!

00:44:59.448 --> 00:45:00.488
Just kidding.

00:45:00.528 --> 00:45:03.968
This thing is called Tiger Spirit.

00:45:04.008 --> 00:45:05.970
Grrr!

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:09.850
Chief.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.368
No, no.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.696
I’m telling you.

00:45:15.248 --> 00:45:16.808
This liquor…

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:19.336
is not a med...

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.512
You’re drunk.

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:25.376
Let’s go home.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.392
Ouch!

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.576
What did you say?

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:33.792
Go home?

00:45:33.824 --> 00:45:34.448
Yes!

00:45:34.488 --> 00:45:35.280
You can’t.

00:45:35.312 --> 00:45:37.744
Exactly. Right, Chief?

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.320
In, listen.

00:45:40.352 --> 00:45:42.232
You’re still young.

00:45:44.272 --> 00:45:47.312
Whatever you want to do, let the elders do it first.

00:45:47.328 --> 00:45:47.896
Yes.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.192
The Chief is still...

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.380
Chief!

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:54.128
Chief!

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.248
Stay with me.

00:45:57.896 --> 00:45:59.900
I don’t want to go home yet.

00:46:00.376 --> 00:46:01.376
Chief!

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:05.344
See you tomorrow.

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:07.520
My arm is sore.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:09.840
What?

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:13.432
Hey, hey, hey.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.230
Ouch.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:19.760
Hello! Is someone over there alright?

00:46:19.808 --> 00:46:22.616
Hey, be quiet.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.860
The villagers are going to chew you out.

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:30.640
It’s cold.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:33.160
Thought you said you’re good at drinking.

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:42.664
You told me yourself that life is short.

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:45.088
Go ahead and drink.

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:47.190
Yeah?

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.704
What about the part where I said don’t bother other people?

00:46:49.728 --> 00:46:51.096
You just skipped that?

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.120
Huh?

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.856
Who am I bothering?

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:00.896
Me, In.

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:03.510
You see?

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:11.368
You’re cute.

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:17.496
Call yourself by your name again.

00:47:18.688 --> 00:47:20.690
And start calling me casually.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.216
Are we close?

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.768
Yes, we’re this close.

00:47:32.848 --> 00:47:33.848
Jeez.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.696
It’s not ‘close.’

00:47:36.912 --> 00:47:38.104
It’s called the ‘carry’ role.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.248
Carry?

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:49.870
What?

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:55.360
The real carry… is me, In.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:47:59.960
Hey, hey!

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:01.610
What now?

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:11.150
Can you take photos for me, please?

00:48:13.432 --> 00:48:17.152
Hey, don’t fall!

00:48:18.696 --> 00:48:19.696
Let go!

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:26.630
Gosh.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:29.008
Hey, what are you doing?

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.992
Look at how wasted you are.

00:48:39.024 --> 00:48:41.264
Would your partner yell at me if they saw you like this?

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.128
What partner?

00:48:43.168 --> 00:48:44.610
Your partner.

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.624
Your mom asked me to read your fortune to see when you’d get married.

00:48:47.648 --> 00:48:48.912
Oh, please.

00:48:49.752 --> 00:48:51.024
No.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.960
No partner at all.

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.408
We broke up a long time ago.

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.680
Yeah?

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.920
Why’d you break up?

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.328
Hey. Did you fall asleep?

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.776
Because of a fortune teller!

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:17.296
Because of a fortune teller.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.296
My ex went to one,

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:25.328
and that fortune teller said we weren’t soulmates.

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:26.870
Me?

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:28.090
Damn it.

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:29.808
Lie down.

00:49:29.832 --> 00:49:31.000
Just rest already.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.792
My partner believed it

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:35.776
and broke up with me!

00:49:36.424 --> 00:49:38.420
Okay, okay.

00:49:38.464 --> 00:49:39.464
Sleep.

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.220
Get some rest.

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:47.120
Wait!

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.464
Oh, gosh.

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:52.688
What the heck?

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.344
Little In.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:05.976
Give me a sponge bath, please.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:07.680
Are you crazy?!

00:50:07.712 --> 00:50:09.240
Please, In.

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.952
Give me a sponge bath or I won’t be able to sleep.

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:15.032
You’re too much.

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:16.760
Lie down. No more requests.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:19.160
But it’s hot.

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.448
Wait, wait, wait.

00:50:21.488 --> 00:50:22.776
Okay, okay.

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:24.160
I’ll get you a towel.

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.200
Wait a sec.

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.560
Would you sit?

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:31.848
Come on, sit right up.

00:50:31.888 --> 00:50:33.060
Up.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.720
Come on.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.208
Turn around.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.952
Why is Mae Hong Son booze so strong?

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:53.664
That’s normal for herbal liquors.

00:50:58.752 --> 00:50:59.752
Oops.

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:43.288
Done.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.024
Can you sleep now?

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:49.980
Hey.

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:52.030
No.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.920
I want to have noodles like before.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.960
Your subconscious is craving something delicious, huh?

00:52:06.984 --> 00:52:08.784
Here, eat.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.176
Then go to bed.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.808
Thank you, sir.

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.832
You’re polite when you’re drunk.

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:41.830
Hey!

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.624
I’m just kidding.

00:52:50.648 --> 00:52:52.008
When will you actually get to eat?

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:54.320
Blow on it.

00:52:54.352 --> 00:52:55.584
It’s hot.

00:52:58.168 --> 00:52:59.424
Thank you, sir.

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.220
Want some?

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:11.888
Hey, stop!

00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:15.760
Only one bite allowed.

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:42.560
The real carry… is me, In.

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:49.152
Have you been carrying so much?

00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.928
I’m the oldest brother.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:02.416
My parents expect me to be

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.304
the one my siblings can rely on.

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.760
They want me to have a complete family

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:10.736
and be a doctor

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.120
so I can take care of everyone.

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:20.024
That must be exhausting.

00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.312
What can I do?

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:35.840
If not a doctor, what would you want to be?

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:50.192
Well, Thap?

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:04.120
You’re the first person to ask me that, In.

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.368
Honestly, I don’t know how to answer.

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:13.016
And you’re asking this while I’m drunk.

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.024
If not a doctor…

00:55:23.624 --> 00:55:25.620
It might sound funny,

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:30.160
but right now, I just want to be idle.

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:37.168
You can be that now.

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:41.968
Right now

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:44.500
Right here.

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.984
You can just be idle.

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:51.080
Stop carrying everything.

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:06.384
It’s because of your dream.

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.432
My life now feels like a dream come true.

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.448
How nice.

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:34.860
Mm.

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.160
How nice.

00:56:37.672 --> 00:56:44.944
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:48.872
No matter how far we drift apart

00:56:48.896 --> 00:56:52.592
We’ll always find a way to restart

00:56:52.632 --> 00:56:58.192
Because in this world, There’s only one you

00:56:58.224 --> 00:57:04.928
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:12.768
Being by my side each day is all I need

00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:18.824
You’re going home for New Year’s?

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:22.328
I think so. My uncle told me to.

00:57:22.848 --> 00:57:24.850
What about you? Going home?

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:27.950
No.

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:30.792
I think I’ll stay here this New Year.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:32.312
Nice weather.

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:34.872
You seem to like Chiang Mai a lot.

00:57:34.912 --> 00:57:36.240
Why not just move here?

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:39.928
Good idea.

00:57:41.664 --> 00:57:43.660
But Chiang Mai can be a bit chaotic.

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.864
Honestly, I prefer Mae Hong Son.

00:57:49.264 --> 00:57:51.260
Guess you need to find a wife there then.

00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:03.776
Oh, boy!

00:58:03.816 --> 00:58:06.768
I really like Mae Hong Son!

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:20.420
Tul!

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:21.740
In.

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:23.696
Thap, how come you’re here with In?

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.592
I’m In’s boyfriend.

00:58:24.616 --> 00:58:26.672
I’m telling you, I don’t buy it.

00:58:26.712 --> 00:58:28.040
My competition is here.

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.400
I have to make a move now, right?

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:34.720
In and I promised that if we’re both single by the time we turn 30, we’d get together.

00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:37.608
Why did you make him that promise if you didn’t even like him?

00:58:37.648 --> 00:58:39.928
Dating a friend should feel pretty good, right?

00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:41.990
Has your heart ever raced with Tul?

00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:45.448
If Tul gets this close, does your heart pound?
