00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.373
(Episode 10)

00:00:06.243 --> 00:00:07.243
What?

00:00:10.813 --> 00:00:11.883
What's this?

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:15.013
Are you here as the boss because this is your first project?

00:00:15.383 --> 00:00:16.383
No.

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:18.753
- Then, what? - I'm here...

00:00:19.323 --> 00:00:20.653
as a worker today.

00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:22.823
A worker?

00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:24.892
You need workers on-site...

00:00:24.893 --> 00:00:26.292
on demolition day.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:27.963
That'd be me.

00:00:28.893 --> 00:00:29.963
Let me get this straight.

00:00:30.393 --> 00:00:33.303
You'll be working here today?

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.333
Yes, right here.

00:00:39.043 --> 00:00:40.473
Are you kidding me?

00:00:41.043 --> 00:00:43.443
We had assigned a demolition team and a handyman...

00:00:43.573 --> 00:00:45.143
before you became the coordinator.

00:00:46.583 --> 00:00:47.713
Is that so?

00:00:47.913 --> 00:00:50.113
Okay, then. I'll put up with it for one day.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.122
That's all I have to do, right?

00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:53.452
I'd like to work...

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.692
whenever you need a handyman.

00:00:54.693 --> 00:00:56.553
I hire the workers I need.

00:00:57.963 --> 00:00:59.263
I need the money.

00:00:59.763 --> 00:01:00.863
For living expenses.

00:01:01.693 --> 00:01:02.993
It won't be every day.

00:01:03.093 --> 00:01:04.863
Just when you need a handyman.

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.733
So I can check the site, learn the ropes,

00:01:08.403 --> 00:01:09.573
and get paid.

00:01:11.803 --> 00:01:13.342
Why are you doing this to me?

00:01:13.343 --> 00:01:15.042
The coordinator gives orders in the morning...

00:01:15.043 --> 00:01:17.012
and can show up or not at lunchtime.

00:01:17.013 --> 00:01:19.482
We'll meet three times a day at most,

00:01:19.483 --> 00:01:22.053
and I'm nothing but a handyman.

00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:24.153
You can treat me as one.

00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:27.483
Right, Ms. Ji?

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:29.092
Mr. Lee.

00:01:29.093 --> 00:01:31.493
Fine. Fire me if you want to.

00:01:31.763 --> 00:01:32.823
But...

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:35.833
you can't avoid me.

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:37.462
As the CEO of Mamdaerozip,

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:40.103
I'll be here often to observe the first project.

00:01:41.103 --> 00:01:42.773
You'll come as the CEO?

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:45.042
Is this the place?

00:01:45.043 --> 00:01:47.442
Oh, hello, Mr. Lee.

00:01:47.443 --> 00:01:49.072
- You're here. - Hello.

00:01:49.073 --> 00:01:50.442
- Hello. - Hello.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:51.643
- Hello. - Hello.

00:01:51.743 --> 00:01:53.483
- You got here early. - Yes.

00:01:55.653 --> 00:01:57.413
(Demolition plan)

00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:00.722
Let me remind you that we'll take everything down.

00:02:00.723 --> 00:02:01.822
It's an old apartment,

00:02:01.823 --> 00:02:03.792
so we can't put new tiles over the old ones.

00:02:03.793 --> 00:02:06.392
Take everything down except the balcony closet.

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:08.632
Oh, we'll paint the walls later,

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:10.462
so scrape off the wallpaper thoroughly.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.063
Okay, got it.

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:13.763
Let's get started.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.202
Let's begin.

00:02:15.203 --> 00:02:16.503
- Okay. - Yes.

00:02:19.543 --> 00:02:21.273
You may leave now.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.343
I know.

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:28.153
I'll take a respite from dust and come back around lunchtime.

00:02:28.183 --> 00:02:30.213
- Thank you for your hard work. - All right.

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:44.733
He will work as a handyman to get paid?

00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:48.073
I have no idea what he's up to.

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:22.533
(Client: Choi Eun Ju)

00:03:28.673 --> 00:03:29.743
Thank you.

00:03:29.913 --> 00:03:33.043
You included everything I needed despite the small budget.

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:35.753
It's my job to find a way.

00:03:35.953 --> 00:03:38.553
And you also agreed to settle for lower-cost materials.

00:03:38.853 --> 00:03:40.853
I'm really excited.

00:03:41.753 --> 00:03:42.793
Me too.

00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:44.993
When it's not even your house?

00:03:45.723 --> 00:03:48.993
When a space changes, so do the people who live there.

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:51.202
It makes you enjoy cooking in the kitchen even more...

00:03:51.203 --> 00:03:53.163
and feel happier when you take a shower.

00:03:53.463 --> 00:03:55.873
It even makes the family gather in the living room more often.

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:58.543
I work on the design, imagining things like that.

00:03:58.843 --> 00:04:00.543
As construction progresses,

00:04:00.843 --> 00:04:03.673
I always feel thrilled to see the house...

00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:05.312
gradually transform over time.

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:07.953
You must love your work a lot.

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:10.983
Oh, right. And...

00:04:13.123 --> 00:04:15.692
These are some photos of lighting and fabrics...

00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:17.893
that I think will suit your taste.

00:04:18.623 --> 00:04:20.992
You can choose the materials with me,

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:24.163
but many clients forget to think about lighting and fabrics,

00:04:24.233 --> 00:04:26.602
and they end up feeling flustered at the last minute.

00:04:26.603 --> 00:04:28.473
I see.

00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:30.073
Thank you.

00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:33.473
I should get going, then.

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:36.342
Okay. I'll make sure to be well prepared...

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:37.642
before the construction starts.

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:38.643
All right.

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:43.283
My gosh. Working as a coordinator seems pretty good.

00:04:43.453 --> 00:04:44.983
You only need to go there in the morning and evening.

00:04:45.023 --> 00:04:46.922
All you need to do is find workers and materials...

00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:48.052
according to the schedule.

00:04:48.053 --> 00:04:50.092
Since I don't need to work on the detailed design,

00:04:50.093 --> 00:04:51.623
I should be responsible for the construction.

00:04:52.493 --> 00:04:53.963
I'm heading out to check the site.

00:04:54.323 --> 00:04:55.592
- Are you going during the day too? - Yes.

00:04:55.593 --> 00:04:56.893
Because it's the first day.

00:04:57.093 --> 00:04:59.003
Will you come back after that...

00:04:59.103 --> 00:05:00.433
and go back there in the evening?

00:05:01.063 --> 00:05:03.072
Today, I'll work at a nearby cafe...

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:04.673
and come back after checking how it all wraps up.

00:05:05.543 --> 00:05:06.703
Okay.

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:09.513
Coffee's cheaper when you factor in the commute and transport costs.

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:11.683
I'll see you later.

00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:17.883
She does need a car.

00:05:18.853 --> 00:05:20.053
That darn Gang Oh.

00:05:28.933 --> 00:05:30.063
Ji Hyuk.

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:31.803
Did you not know your food expenses were covered?

00:05:32.663 --> 00:05:33.663
I knew.

00:05:33.664 --> 00:05:35.373
Then why are you eating cup noodles?

00:05:35.803 --> 00:05:37.773
Didn't the chief order your food?

00:05:38.973 --> 00:05:41.713
I'd like to receive my food expenses in cash.

00:05:45.743 --> 00:05:48.883
Why? Do you feel bad that I'm eating cup noodles?

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:52.153
Of course, I do. A lot.

00:05:52.783 --> 00:05:54.452
Like that's enough to recharge you,

00:05:54.453 --> 00:05:55.723
when I know how much you eat.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.993
Ms. Ji, how could you possibly tell how much strangers eat?

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:03.233
You're not a stranger. You're a handyman on my project.

00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:05.233
Oh, right.

00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:07.703
I'm a handyman on your team.

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:11.743
Seriously...

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:17.713
(Cup noodles)

00:06:28.893 --> 00:06:30.493
(Mamdaerozip)

00:06:33.863 --> 00:06:36.893
My goodness. I didn't know you were here, Mr. Lee.

00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:39.133
Are you here because it's the first day?

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:40.603
Hello.

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:42.903
No, because you are my first client.

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:45.273
I'll help with the work and check things.

00:06:45.803 --> 00:06:47.073
You'll help with the work?

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:49.142
On the schedule, you can find the days with a handyman.

00:06:49.143 --> 00:06:51.343
I'll be the handyman on those days.

00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:53.582
I won't be working for free, though.

00:06:53.583 --> 00:06:54.783
I should be paid.

00:06:55.613 --> 00:06:59.223
I really like your mindset.

00:06:59.783 --> 00:07:01.893
I feel reassured to have you here.

00:07:02.553 --> 00:07:04.152
The demolition team should leave soon.

00:07:04.153 --> 00:07:05.762
As I texted you this afternoon,

00:07:05.763 --> 00:07:08.363
please wire the daily wages for the chief and him.

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:09.863
Sure.

00:07:11.193 --> 00:07:12.203
And the lunch money.

00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:17.103
He had lunch separately today.

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:20.073
Please send him an extra ten dollars for lunch.

00:07:20.743 --> 00:07:21.743
Okay.

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:38.693
(Hyunmyeong Apartment)

00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:48.133
(Hyunmyeong Apartment)

00:07:53.503 --> 00:07:54.913
You don't want to be on the same bus as me, right?

00:08:08.223 --> 00:08:10.223
But I got here first.

00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:16.062
Hey, how did it go today?

00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:18.163
Hang on. Is the man in the storage back yet?

00:08:18.763 --> 00:08:19.863
The man in the storage?

00:08:22.273 --> 00:08:23.432
(If you look at the company introduction, )

00:08:23.433 --> 00:08:24.503
(you'll learn about Mamdaerozip's system.)

00:08:27.143 --> 00:08:29.042
Ji Hyuk, from now on, wait your turn.

00:08:29.043 --> 00:08:30.173
No cutting in line.

00:08:30.473 --> 00:08:32.282
I got to the bus stop first,

00:08:32.283 --> 00:08:33.742
so I had to get on first.

00:08:33.743 --> 00:08:36.153
I did it so you wouldn't have to see my face.

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:40.083
The first person to arrive should be the first to get on.

00:08:45.663 --> 00:08:46.663
Thanks.

00:08:52.503 --> 00:08:53.763
What is going on between you two?

00:08:55.133 --> 00:08:57.533
He came to my construction site as a handyman.

00:08:57.673 --> 00:08:58.743
Ji Hyuk did?

00:09:00.443 --> 00:09:03.443
That's why he was soaked in sweat.

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.243
He says he needs money.

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:08.253
How can he run a business when he has no money?

00:09:08.353 --> 00:09:09.513
My point, exactly.

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:12.953
Why did you not tell me when you were here earlier?

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:14.653
I thought I'd explode if I brought it up.

00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:19.693
Su Jeong, I'm starving. I'll go to a convenience store.

00:09:19.963 --> 00:09:21.023
Okay.

00:09:41.853 --> 00:09:43.913
- Please enjoy it. - Thank you.

00:09:46.623 --> 00:09:48.823
Hey. Are you eating triangle gimbap again?

00:09:51.493 --> 00:09:54.063
Wait. What is this smell?

00:09:54.163 --> 00:09:55.792
I smell ramyeon.

00:09:55.793 --> 00:09:56.863
Really?

00:09:58.403 --> 00:09:59.833
I think I'm smelling it too.

00:10:01.163 --> 00:10:03.573
I guess Ji Hyuk is eating cup noodles again.

00:10:04.073 --> 00:10:05.103
What?

00:10:05.543 --> 00:10:08.443
I even left a note that he couldn't eat raymeon here.

00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:46.683
The bride seems to be walking a little slowly.

00:10:47.543 --> 00:10:49.413
Please come on out.

00:10:57.593 --> 00:11:00.063
I already know you're a jerk,

00:11:00.563 --> 00:11:03.062
so don't pretend to be a good guy.

00:11:03.063 --> 00:11:04.263
That's not like you.

00:11:05.763 --> 00:11:07.603
No, scratch that.

00:11:08.373 --> 00:11:10.133
This is exactly who you are.

00:11:10.933 --> 00:11:13.173
Only I didn't know, since I was so delusional.

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:15.213
"Ji Eun Oh,"

00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:19.443
"you and your family are just too poor for me..."

00:11:19.543 --> 00:11:22.453
"to even consider you, so know your place."

00:11:23.653 --> 00:11:25.583
If you had been honest with me,

00:11:25.683 --> 00:11:27.583
I would've easily gotten the message.

00:11:28.323 --> 00:11:31.452
But right up to the end, you didn't bother to tell me...

00:11:31.453 --> 00:11:33.192
how you really felt...

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:34.493
and left me guessing.

00:11:34.663 --> 00:11:36.692
You fed me your twisted logic and absurd excuses...

00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:38.663
while being a pretentious jerk, until the very end.

00:11:40.003 --> 00:11:41.803
What you really wanted...

00:11:42.073 --> 00:11:45.443
was an easy life, wealth, and status...

00:11:45.473 --> 00:11:46.902
through marriage,

00:11:46.903 --> 00:11:48.813
even if there was no love...

00:11:50.013 --> 00:11:51.043
or affection.

00:11:52.783 --> 00:11:53.883
But you pretended otherwise,

00:11:54.443 --> 00:11:56.853
as if you righteously sided with the little guys...

00:11:56.953 --> 00:11:59.083
and stayed unmarried to remain free.

00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:02.293
I'm furious that you lied to me all this time.

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:06.463
It's so infuriating that it's sickening.

00:12:06.523 --> 00:12:08.293
This is where it ends between us.

00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:13.163
We're no longer friends or anything else. Got it?

00:12:16.673 --> 00:12:17.673
Okay.

00:12:33.353 --> 00:12:34.723
We're almost done.

00:12:36.153 --> 00:12:37.153
My gosh.

00:12:38.893 --> 00:12:39.923
Ha Eun.

00:12:41.893 --> 00:12:43.293
Is this enough space?

00:12:45.963 --> 00:12:47.663
It's a bit tight.

00:12:48.603 --> 00:12:50.072
- But it works. - It does?

00:12:50.073 --> 00:12:51.333
Yes. It's okay.

00:12:51.533 --> 00:12:52.543
Okay.

00:12:55.113 --> 00:12:58.582
Once we get rid of this, we'll have our studio.

00:12:58.583 --> 00:13:00.843
What should we do about that in the corner?

00:13:01.183 --> 00:13:03.083
That? I think we can leave it.

00:13:04.113 --> 00:13:06.552
- I just had a great idea. - What is it?

00:13:06.553 --> 00:13:08.392
I can pull the outfits out from there one at a time.

00:13:08.393 --> 00:13:10.393
What do you think?

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:11.523
Sounds good.

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:13.393
I must be a genius.

00:13:13.523 --> 00:13:14.623
Here you go.

00:13:16.633 --> 00:13:18.062
Eat all you want.

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:20.103
I'll eat later with your dad.

00:13:20.303 --> 00:13:22.102
Ha Eun, eat all you can.

00:13:22.103 --> 00:13:23.903
I will. Thank you.

00:13:25.643 --> 00:13:27.443
What's up with her today?

00:13:34.713 --> 00:13:36.912
Your mom's an awesome cook.

00:13:36.913 --> 00:13:38.323
The food's so good.

00:13:39.023 --> 00:13:40.123
Let's see the response.

00:13:43.223 --> 00:13:44.552
It's the same as yesterday.

00:13:44.553 --> 00:13:45.592
(Couple's outfits for classy art and music events)

00:13:45.593 --> 00:13:46.922
His face is blurred,

00:13:46.923 --> 00:13:49.262
but his aura shines through it.

00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:50.962
Is there another boyfriend like him out there?

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:53.002
He's a model, not my boyfriend.

00:13:53.003 --> 00:13:55.233
He's acting like he's your boyfriend.

00:13:55.403 --> 00:13:57.472
I don't know what he's actually like,

00:13:57.473 --> 00:13:59.143
but he has a perfect figure and a great sense of fashion.

00:13:59.743 --> 00:14:01.302
He's even more perfect on the inside.

00:14:01.303 --> 00:14:02.543
He's a third-generation heir.

00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:05.683
No one's asking when our next video will be up.

00:14:07.343 --> 00:14:10.352
Binny, will this boyfriend be in the next video?

00:14:10.353 --> 00:14:12.723
Binny. If he's not your boyfriend, can you set me up with him?

00:14:13.453 --> 00:14:15.022
Dream on, people.

00:14:15.023 --> 00:14:16.722
He's a sweet guy who studied abroad.

00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:18.463
He's a perfect hexagon who has everything.

00:14:19.193 --> 00:14:20.193
What?

00:14:20.663 --> 00:14:21.863
A hexagon?

00:14:55.733 --> 00:14:58.092
Eun Oh. What are you doing here?

00:14:58.093 --> 00:14:59.103
My gosh.

00:14:59.433 --> 00:15:00.733
I was just...

00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:05.543
The cafe felt a bit suffocating.

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:07.673
The cafe?

00:15:09.443 --> 00:15:11.643
You feel suffocated in the cafe?

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:20.752
I get it, but at the same time, I don't.

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.853
He feels so different that it's uncomfortable.

00:15:24.393 --> 00:15:26.792
No. Maybe I feel this way...

00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:28.833
because I don't get it.

00:15:29.063 --> 00:15:30.992
Why did he suddenly start his own business?

00:15:30.993 --> 00:15:33.002
Why does he have to work at the cafe, of all places?

00:15:33.003 --> 00:15:34.263
And why is he acting like this?

00:15:34.703 --> 00:15:36.833
It's all so unfamiliar and weird.

00:15:37.433 --> 00:15:40.303
Do I feel uncomfortable because I don't know...

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:41.943
what Ji Hyuk is doing?

00:15:43.413 --> 00:15:46.513
I can't pull all-nighters at the cafe like I used to.

00:15:47.083 --> 00:15:50.113
Isn't it too much for him to intrude on my projects too?

00:15:51.113 --> 00:15:52.723
- It is. - Isn't it?

00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:55.023
But Eun Oh.

00:15:56.393 --> 00:15:57.893
I think...

00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:00.823
what you need right now...

00:16:01.693 --> 00:16:02.863
is a businessperson's mindset.

00:16:04.063 --> 00:16:05.803
A businessperson's mindset?

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:08.533
I get why you feel the way you do.

00:16:09.403 --> 00:16:12.473
You said you wanted to treat Ji Hyuk as if he were a stranger.

00:16:13.343 --> 00:16:15.643
That means you want to erase your shared past.

00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:19.713
All you have to do is delete him from your list of acquaintances,

00:16:20.343 --> 00:16:22.813
no matter what happens later.

00:16:23.653 --> 00:16:25.222
You're already sharing a space.

00:16:25.223 --> 00:16:26.822
Telling him not to say hi...

00:16:26.823 --> 00:16:28.753
and to treat you like you're invisible.

00:16:30.353 --> 00:16:33.463
It makes it seem like you still have some unfinished emotional business.

00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:38.732
I really don't feel anything at all.

00:16:38.733 --> 00:16:42.103
You're disappointed in him, and you're angry,

00:16:42.933 --> 00:16:45.572
so you don't want to see him again. I get it.

00:16:45.573 --> 00:16:46.903
I'd feel the same too.

00:16:47.143 --> 00:16:49.012
But you share a space already,

00:16:49.013 --> 00:16:50.113
and there's no going back.

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:51.813
However,

00:16:53.243 --> 00:16:55.413
if you can both benefit from a business perspective,

00:16:56.383 --> 00:16:58.983
you can still do business together.

00:17:01.183 --> 00:17:02.193
I see.

00:17:03.623 --> 00:17:04.693
I guess...

00:17:05.493 --> 00:17:08.733
I failed to keep my feelings and work apart.

00:17:11.493 --> 00:17:13.933
I'm just saying you shouldn't waste your energy.

00:17:27.183 --> 00:17:28.243
A hexagon?

00:17:28.953 --> 00:17:31.782
Yes. Seong Jae's a perfect hexagon.

00:17:31.783 --> 00:17:33.123
Way out of their league.

00:17:34.483 --> 00:17:36.152
He is in my league.

00:17:36.153 --> 00:17:37.993
He's my brother's best friend.

00:17:39.693 --> 00:17:40.893
Yes, Seong Jae.

00:17:41.563 --> 00:17:44.092
He's good-looking, has a great personality,

00:17:44.093 --> 00:17:45.332
has a perfect background,

00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:47.603
is well-educated, has a good job,

00:17:48.403 --> 00:17:49.773
and has lots of money.

00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:53.543
That's him. It's Seong Jae.

00:17:54.773 --> 00:17:55.773
Yes.

00:17:56.073 --> 00:17:58.113
Why didn't I think of that?

00:18:00.043 --> 00:18:01.043
Hey.

00:18:04.213 --> 00:18:05.213
What's this?

00:18:06.153 --> 00:18:08.353
Su Bin. I wish you the best.

00:18:08.823 --> 00:18:10.223
Good luck, darling.

00:18:15.863 --> 00:18:17.063
Mom...

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:29.673
- You're still up? - What?

00:18:30.013 --> 00:18:31.713
- Aren't you tired? - No.

00:18:32.183 --> 00:18:35.513
You know I have enough energy to run a half-marathon every year.

00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:38.413
But you study on weekends too.

00:18:39.023 --> 00:18:41.083
It's all good, but you should take a day off.

00:18:41.283 --> 00:18:43.493
I will, once I pass the written exam.

00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:02.673
Yes, honey.

00:19:03.073 --> 00:19:05.283
Let's push our lunch back by 20 minutes.

00:19:06.043 --> 00:19:08.312
Hyeonu Fashion's CEO Min Tae Ho...

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:10.513
suddenly said he'd come by at 11am.

00:19:13.383 --> 00:19:15.693
I might have to miss the scholarship ceremony.

00:19:16.993 --> 00:19:18.092
It's for business?

00:19:18.093 --> 00:19:19.093
Yes.

00:19:19.563 --> 00:19:21.793
He's planning to launch a new line,

00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:24.762
and our shoes suddenly came to mind.

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:26.433
He suggested we collaborate.

00:19:27.463 --> 00:19:29.803
He brought up something that important so suddenly?

00:19:30.803 --> 00:19:32.072
He's famous for being like that.

00:19:32.073 --> 00:19:34.703
He's nicknamed "Suddenly" because he's so impatient.

00:19:36.013 --> 00:19:39.513
How about we have lunch some other day?

00:19:40.283 --> 00:19:42.453
The meeting could drag on.

00:19:43.613 --> 00:19:45.653
I'd feel terrible to do that to you.

00:19:45.853 --> 00:19:48.753
Don't say that. That's just silly.

00:19:50.253 --> 00:19:51.653
I'll see you at home in the evening.

00:20:08.673 --> 00:20:10.472
- Yes, Mom. - Yeong Ra.

00:20:10.473 --> 00:20:12.613
Have lunch with your dad today.

00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:14.383
Why?

00:20:14.783 --> 00:20:16.213
Surprise.

00:20:19.453 --> 00:20:21.082
We'll begin...

00:20:21.083 --> 00:20:23.422
the Gaon Scholarship certificate presentation ceremony...

00:20:23.423 --> 00:20:26.392
for students from Sirim High School,

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:28.622
Jayeon High School, Seongsil Girls' High School,

00:20:28.623 --> 00:20:31.292
and Haesang High School for the 2nd half of 2025.

00:20:31.293 --> 00:20:32.863
(Gaon Foundation Scholarship Presentation Ceremony)

00:20:37.303 --> 00:20:40.303
There will be a welcome speech by the foundation director.

00:20:48.283 --> 00:20:49.482
Hello.

00:20:49.483 --> 00:20:51.683
I'm Ko Seong Hui, Gaon Foundation's director.

00:20:52.153 --> 00:20:53.553
I'll keep it short.

00:20:54.083 --> 00:20:56.122
We're here to celebrate the students...

00:20:56.123 --> 00:20:58.992
from each of the schools who are here...

00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:00.963
to receive the scholarship, not me.

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:04.432
Thank you so much for studying hard...

00:21:04.433 --> 00:21:06.503
despite your difficult circumstances.

00:21:06.763 --> 00:21:10.203
I wish you good health as you strive to achieve your dreams.

00:21:16.773 --> 00:21:20.643
Now, we shall present the scholarship certificates.

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:25.153
Are you all ready?

00:21:26.623 --> 00:21:27.623
Smile.

00:21:27.623 --> 00:21:28.623
(Gaon Foundation)

00:21:32.963 --> 00:21:34.392
Congratulations.

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:36.333
- Well done. - Thank you.

00:21:37.393 --> 00:21:40.203
Secretary Ko. Take them to the restaurant.

00:21:42.833 --> 00:21:44.503
I'll take a photo of just you four.

00:21:45.603 --> 00:21:48.602
I asked you not to come because it's too embarrassing.

00:21:48.603 --> 00:21:52.383
Foundations like yours that keep these ceremonies on the low...

00:21:52.613 --> 00:21:53.883
are pretty rare.

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:56.352
Why would you make a big fuss...

00:21:56.353 --> 00:21:58.753
about a company sponsoring promising students?

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.240
Where's the site you're working on?

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.280
I'll come to you.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.780
Let's grab lunch together.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.450
I'm at the office today.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.520
I'm aware of how stalkers operate.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.120
I know from experience.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:19.560
A serious stalker like this...

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.300
won't back out easily.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.670
They lie in wait for hours or days, hoping their obsession will slip up.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:31.970
How dare you go after Park Yeong Ra?

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.940
Don't you even think about it. Yeong Ra is under my protection!

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.110
I'm her friend, after all!

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.820
(Seong Jae's Mom)

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:44.749
This is Lee Ji Wan.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.350
Pick Yeong Ra up at the studio at 11:30am.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.290
- Don't be late. - Sure.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.400
This was not part of her schedule today.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.570
She never tells me why, though.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:00.970
I'm always in the dark.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.640
All I have to do is drive, is that it?

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.510
Why are you headed to your dad's office today?

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.810
Mom said I should have lunch with him.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.820
- Out of the blue? - Yes.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:18.890
Why?

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.620
I don't know.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.760
So you're going to lunch with him because she told you to?

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:27.959
Yes.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.500
(Dad)

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.070
Dad, it's me.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.069
I was with a friend...

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.540
and noticed your office on the way back.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.240
I thought we could have lunch.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.310
Really?

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:45.250
Sure, come on over, Yeong Ra.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:47.180
Right.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.280
What would you like to have?

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.390
It'll take around an hour and a half.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.960
Sure. I'll grab lunch nearby.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.380
- Dad. - You were already here.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.880
This is such a surprise.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.520
Hello, sir.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:23.580
He's a friend of mine.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.850
This is CEO Min Tae Ho of Hyeonu Fashion.

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:29.160
- This is my daughter. - Is that so?

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.959
I'm Park Yeong Ra.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.100
Goodness. You're even more beautiful than I had heard.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.059
- Is that so? - Absolutely.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.169
And here I thought she was only pretty in my eyes.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:40.570
As if that makes any sense.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.139
Darn, I'm starving.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.210
- You may cross. - What should I eat?

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.550
What?

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.550
- Seong Jae. - Hey.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.219
- What? - It might be dangerous,

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.060
so please wait for the next light.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.760
(Hamham Hangover Soup)

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.200
Welcome.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.970
Would it kill you to talk while you eat?

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.540
I need to hurry back. I've got a pile of work to do.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.550
Say whatever's on your mind. I'll listen while eating.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.220
I want you to be the one to talk.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.020
About what?

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:33.350
Hey.

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.620
Before you came back to Seoul and even after you arrived,

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.390
you never talked with me...

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.700
about starting a business.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.400
I simply didn't have the time...

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.640
or the luxury to discuss this with you.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:50.700
As if that's an excuse.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.640
Not everyone thinks the same way.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.910
Our situation may change how we think.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.910
Just let it go, Seong Jae.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:01.420
So?

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.920
You thought it'd be best to work out of a storage area?

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.250
Yes.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.190
Ji Hyuk.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.790
Let's get you a decent office.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.159
I'll invest in your business.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.860
- I'll decline. - Why?

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.200
Because I'm doing just fine.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.870
How a business looks from the outside...

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.800
matters more than you think.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.340
Besides, there's more to it than just you being okay with it.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.040
How long have we been friends, and what kind of friends are we?

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.410
Why can't I invest...

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.480
in a friend's business?

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.180
It's not like I'd pay millions.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.850
That's exactly why I don't need your help.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.920
My future will be bright despite the humble beginning.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.290
Hey.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.160
How can you be this cruel?

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.700
Business or not,

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.700
she shouldn't have to face you every day.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.739
Eun Oh and I already sorted this out.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.810
More like you laid it out on her.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.250
Are you taking her side?

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.750
This isn't about taking someone's side.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.579
My investment in your business will solve everything.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.290
It's best for you and for Eun Oh too.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.360
Seong Jae.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.390
I have my own plan.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.030
I want to make it without anyone's help.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.000
Sure, but even your business comes with its issues.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.400
You jumped into this without thinking it through.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:28.370
How can a business succeed...

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.709
when you hardly prepared? It was only a few months.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.470
I worked so hard...

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.010
that it felt like a day was 10 days, and an hour was 24 hours.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.910
Stop being stubborn about this.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.580
You really think less of me, don't you?

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.480
Hey, Park Seong Jae.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.280
Who are you to tell me to move offices?

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.689
I don't know how you and Eun Oh...

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.960
got this close in the short time I was gone,

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.920
but zip it.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.900
I don't need help from you, my parents, or anyone else.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.330
Succeed or fail,

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.100
I'll do it on my own.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.280
Ji Hyuk!

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.090
What on earth?

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.390
Were you in Seoul this whole time?

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.719
Are you actually back? When did you get here?

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.889
What brings you to this neighbourhood?

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.490
Answer me first!

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:28.000
Does everyone have to stand in my way?

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.200
Shut it.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:30.730
Now, talk.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.099
Don't tell Mom and Dad I'm back.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.340
No way. I'm telling them.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:39.210
Why shouldn't I?

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.540
Ji Hyuk, don't you think you're being too selfish?

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.610
Mom and Grandma were worried sick about you!

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.220
- I know. - If you actually understood,

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.350
you would've come home since you were in Seoul.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.590
How could you not even call?

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.330
Ji Wan, I started a business.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.500
A business?

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.370
You remember the state I was in when I ran away.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.770
Of course.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.239
It was beyond pathetic.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.280
Then you must know the way I wish to be when I return.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.279
Which is what?

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.150
Can't you see that I want to return as a proud son?

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.980
I get that,

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.190
but I don't believe a word you're saying.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.490
How does this make sense?

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.359
It's only been a few months since you left home.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.490
How can you start a business, and with what money?

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.730
Are you going to keep quiet if I show you?

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.930
What?

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.900
- Sure. - Follow me.

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.400
Hold on, Ji Hyuk. Did you really start a business?

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.550
He's upsetting everyone around him.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.390
Ji Hyuk, why are you headed inside a cafe?

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:02.960
I thought you said you got yourself an office.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.770
Come in.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.700
No way.

I never doubted you.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:29.750
Keep quiet, or you'll pay.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.990
Of course. I know you become the Hulk when you're angry.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.560
All right. I won't tell the family until you make it big.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.960
- Return home in glory. - Don't be gross.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.370
By the way, what are you wearing?

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:47.970
Why are you dressed like that?

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:51.840
Get going already!

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.310
I have to hurry back anyway.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.780
Ji Wan.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.950
Is everyone doing all right?

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.360
The family...

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:10.660
is staying strong.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.030
I mean, they're trying to act strong while waiting for you.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:16.960
Because we believe in you.

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.090
Oh, gosh. You're having a late lunch.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.159
- That would be 1.2 dollars. - Okay.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.660
I had a special lecture.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:52.070
Have you been working here for a long time?

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.099
It's only been a month.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.969
I see. Is there anything you find challenging?

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.569
No. There's nothing difficult.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.539
Right, thank you.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.609
Have a nice day.

That darn rascal.

He doesn't even call me once.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.700
He will be in big trouble when he comes back home.

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.020
Let's get you a decent office.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.420
I'll invest in your business.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.289
How can a business succeed...

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.630
when you hardly prepared?

You'll come back when you hear from the company...

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.000
you applied to, won't you?

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.330
You must've applied to a few places.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.749
(1,000 dollars)

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:15.450
So you don't trust me either.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:18.720
Just like how Eun Oh doesn't.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:21.690
You don't trust me.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.060
That...

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.630
A businessperson's mindset.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.760
Keep business and personal matters separate.

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.270
You said you installed the window because it was suffocating.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.880
Now that you've made a hole in a perfectly good wall,

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.310
you should keep the door closed.

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.789
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:29.960
Because it feels new.

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:33.130
People have many different sides to them.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
What?

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.270
I'm not saying it's upsetting.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.470
It's rather surprising.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.210
You have so many talents I never knew about.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:50.780
You and Seong Jae became best friends before I knew it.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.809
You must've told him that you hated me a lot.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:55.220
Just because I went to the construction site,

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.150
Seong Jae got just as furious as you.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.250
You're quite talented.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.590
What...

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.360
Darn it.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.100
What's that supposed to mean?

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:10.760
I'm talented?

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.999
What do you take me for?

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.669
What's with the sarcasm? You think I'm talented?

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.400
What do you mean by that?

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.740
You have every right to hate me,

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.180
but enough is enough.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.680
Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:27.450
Enough.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.420
What, am I a traitor to your family or something?

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.950
Let's just be like strangers, okay?

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:34.689
What's so hard about that?

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.590
You're the one who barged in here!

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.260
You're right.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:46.300
I did.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.400
Yes.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.340
I'm sorry about that.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.469
Whoever this place belongs to,

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:55.980
and even if I mistreated you or did something worse,

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:57.909
you don't have the right to be sarcastic with me.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:59.050
Why are you being sarcastic?

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.820
Seong Jae and I go back nine years.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.190
You do. I get it.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.790
I already apologised.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.360
Shall we stop now?

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.090
I won't keep the door open ever again.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.349
You must've told him that you hated me a lot.

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:40.989
Just because I went to the construction site,

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:43.290
Seong Jae got just as furious as you.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.690
You're quite talented.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.430
Why did I do that?

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.630
Why did I say that?

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:55.770
He's his friend, after all.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:02.940
You should've held it back, Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.110
You've already done enough wrong to Eun Oh.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.820
You stupid thing.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.559
Double S Startup.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.929
You have passed the first round...

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:22.960
of the 2025 Early Startup Project.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.300
That's it.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:26.770
This is it.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.240
This is how Lee Ji Hyuk should be.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.940
Ji Hyuk will never forgive me.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.410
I stopped him from studying abroad.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:39.679
So he majored in business administration...

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.810
to get a job.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.150
That's why he decided...

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.149
not to get married or have children...

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:48.220
as a lower-middle-class citizen.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.920
He chose to live a carefree life. Oh, boy.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.890
That's all my fault.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.730
This means I'm a lousy excuse for a father.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.160
So, that's what it is.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.300
I wondered why you were trying so hard.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.800
It was because you hurt your child.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.070
I mean, it wasn't just his feelings you hurt.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:10.739
My entire life as Lee Sang Cheol...

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.980
was completely despised.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:13.510
Sang Cheol.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:15.980
That would be an over-interpretation.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.250
Isn't that ridiculous? I chased after that punk.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:23.620
I mistook a stranger for Ji Hyuk.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.430
The thing is,

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.260
when your child grows up, they make you uncomfortable...

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.530
and afraid.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:32.900
You're right. You can't help but walk on eggshells.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:35.140
Still, you pretend not to be like that,

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.540
acting as if you were still a strong, authoritative father.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:44.040
I won't be like that anymore. Never.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:47.750
You go to an academy and work part-time every other day.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.549
Is it doable?

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:50.679
Of course.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.750
I can handle it. I'm fine.

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:00.560
Are you going out again?

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:03.459
Yes. I told you.

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.630
I met Myeong Suk, my hometown friend,

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.470
and the senior citizen center in her neighbourhood was really nice.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.040
Which neighbourhood?

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:15.139
I don't know the exact location.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:18.449
And it's not like I'm there all day.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:19.949
I go to Myeong Suk's place...

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.920
and visit her neighbours too.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.020
- I'll see you later. - Okay.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:30.390
What's gotten into her lately?

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.559
She used to be such a homebody,

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.360
but she goes out every day these days.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.339
Finding a job...

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.440
with an elementary school teaching license.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.940
In my late 50s.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.049
(5 certificates for a new beginning)

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:55.650
(Jobs for people in their 50s. Isn't it too late?)

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.190
(Where can I find a job as a daycare teacher?)

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:24.009
In cases like this, you measure the shape of the wall...

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:25.409
and build the closet...

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:28.379
based on the front size, not the wall itself.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.319
I see. So you fill the gaps inside...

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.649
using silicone...

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:33.390
or cover them with molding.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.989
I can tell you've studied a lot, Mr. Lee.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:39.190
It's not easy to pick up on-site know-how.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.130
Ji Hyuk.

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.829
You're here as a handyman, so make sure to do your job.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.869
Don't disturb the carpentry chief.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:49.199
I was talking with him as he wanted a short break.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.199
But you are not working.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.540
We should be finished soon. Aren't you going to clean up?

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.579
Chief, who's your regular materials supplier?

00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.679
The materials look nice.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.909
Have you been doing business with them for a long time?

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:02.150
He keeps asking questions.

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:06.190
Mr. Lee. Will you be doing business with me?

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:07.990
Then I'll tell you.

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:12.090
Chief.

00:41:12.091 --> 00:41:13.630
Yes, Ms. Ji.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.100
Don't you think the shadow here looks wonky?

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:19.800
What?

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:21.770
It looks even and horizontal,

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.870
but if you look carefully, the shadow's uneven.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.839
Yes, you're right.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.010
Did we push the wood too far?

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.240
It will become too obvious when we put in the indirect lights.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.079
I think it'll be fine if you put in a little plank...

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.650
to make it even.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.550
Pretty good.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.189
- Cha. - Yes?

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.250
Come over here.

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:45.190
Do you see how the shadow here isn't even?

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.570
This section needs to be evened out.

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:12.850
What was that about?

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.760
I got on first.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.970
He never keeps his word.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.500
Thank you.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:09.110
Keep your wits about you.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.350
Did you just speak casually to me?

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:16.650
I did. So what?

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:19.650
Get off.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.740
I vented to Mr. Park about you.

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:40.440
I shouldn't have.

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:46.180
I shouldn't have been sarcastic about it.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.420
We're even, then.

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:54.850
Shall we forget about it, then?

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.180
Hello.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:20.710
Did you make up? You came in together.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.319
We didn't come in together.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.380
You did. Just a few steps apart.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:26.350
Oh, that?

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.060
We happened to come in around the same time.

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.960
- What? - How were the sales today?

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.030
It was okay.

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:35.930
How do you feel?

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:39.570
You had to pay for the stuff you broke because of Gang Oh.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.040
I'm telling myself I paid it to teach him a lesson.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:20.110
Just so you know, we set a date for the Mapo apartment.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:21.940
When is it?

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.940
I posted the schedule outside your office.

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.550
What...

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.580
She's still like this?

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:33.020
She has no businesswoman's mindset.

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:37.959
You can take your credit card.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.390
- I'll call when your drink's ready. - Okay, thanks.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.860
Ms. Ji, what's this?

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:47.999
Mamdaerozip's site and the Mapo site.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.340
I scheduled them so I don't have to be at two places at once.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.240
I need a briefing.

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:55.440
Please.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:57.909
On day one of Eunoism's demolition,

00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:00.650
I'll check out the Mapo site first thing in the morning.

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:02.979
That's day two of painting the Mamdaerozip site,

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.119
so I'm not needed in the morning.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.920
I can drop by in the afternoon to see how it looks.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.019
On day two of tearing down the Mapo site,

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.990
I'll be at Mamdaerozip's site in the morning.

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.030
The flooring goes down that day.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.060
I'll be at my site in the afternoon...

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:17.200
to wrap up the last day of demolition.

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:19.329
If you look at each date,

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:21.600
there's either an O or an X for each morning and afternoon.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.370
That shows where I'll be so that everything goes smoothly...

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:27.110
and nothing overlaps.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.040
Do I need to go on?

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:33.550
No, I get it now. It makes sense.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.580
Gosh, you're really smart.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.590
You planned when to begin working on the Mapo site...

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.920
based on the schedule for the Mamdaerozip site.

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:45.830
Yes, but...

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:48.330
you're talking down to me again.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.130
What?

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:55.530
Oh, sorry. I'm just amazed. That's all.

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:03.340
Was she that clever?

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:09.220
- Cheers. - Cheers.

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.419
(Inwang Industries)

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:13.520
Hey.

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:17.090
You were all over the news.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.590
Why did you put money in a fake stock firm?

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.659
Do you think I wanted to?

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.760
You're a mess.

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:26.129
I trusted you and almost lost...

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:27.770
my successful singles' bar.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.669
Thanks to you, Yang Jin Gu got a stake in the business.

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:34.569
Seo Dong Wu. Are you pouring gas on a fire?

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:35.570
"Are you pouring gas?"

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.510
Ji Gang Oh, you fool.

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.480
Gang Oh. Ask your family for just 20,000 dollars.

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:44.350
Then I'll make you a partner.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.020
The one condition is that you work at the bar too.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.189
You're pretty to look at,

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:53.290
so I'll give you a stake for just 20,000 dollars.

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:57.600
- For 20,000 dollars? - Yes.

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.070
Forget it, Gang Oh.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:03.240
Your sister paid to get you out of trouble.

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.340
- Oh, dear. - He's penniless.

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:09.040
How do you know if I'm penniless or not?

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:11.940
I'm penniless, but my mom isn't.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.720
(Incoming call: Mom)

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.890
- Where's he going? - What's that about?

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.860
Let's drink.

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.490
Gang Oh.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:29.430
We're really busy. You said you'd be here soon.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:31.530
How many tables do you have?

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:33.670
Enough that I want to call Eun Oh.

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:36.340
Fine. I'll be there soon.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.340
He's scared of his sister,

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:41.593
- but he's still distracted. - Excuse me.

00:48:57.664 --> 00:48:58.664
Oh my.

00:49:08.644 --> 00:49:11.644
He looks a lot like my dad.

00:49:24.354 --> 00:49:25.394
Hey.

00:49:28.464 --> 00:49:32.264
Are you here about the job in Unit 702?

00:49:32.394 --> 00:49:34.334
Yes, that's right.

00:49:34.434 --> 00:49:37.204
It's my first job. I'm Lee Sang Cheol.

00:49:37.364 --> 00:49:38.904
Nice to meet you.

00:49:38.974 --> 00:49:41.444
- I'm in charge. - I see.

00:49:41.944 --> 00:49:44.244
There's still some time.

00:49:44.304 --> 00:49:45.814
Why did you rush?

00:49:46.144 --> 00:49:48.843
It's my first time on an interior job,

00:49:48.844 --> 00:49:51.454
so I hoped to take a look around.

00:49:52.114 --> 00:49:54.214
The security guard won't let me in.

00:49:54.724 --> 00:49:56.454
Oh, I see.

00:49:57.854 --> 00:49:59.894
Mister. Can I see your hands?

00:50:00.824 --> 00:50:01.824
My hands?

00:50:05.434 --> 00:50:08.904
You had a desk job your whole life.

00:50:10.764 --> 00:50:12.134
There are no calluses.

00:50:12.734 --> 00:50:14.374
Are your shoulders and back in good shape?

00:50:15.004 --> 00:50:16.373
Of course, they are.

00:50:16.374 --> 00:50:18.373
I might not have worked on an interior design project,

00:50:18.374 --> 00:50:19.973
but I worked at a distribution center,

00:50:19.974 --> 00:50:21.413
sorted through discarded clothes,

00:50:21.414 --> 00:50:22.713
and even took jobs...

00:50:22.714 --> 00:50:24.584
such as shelving at a supermarket.

00:50:24.984 --> 00:50:26.013
I know.

00:50:26.014 --> 00:50:27.813
When my dad's business went under,

00:50:27.814 --> 00:50:29.324
he took every job he could find.

00:50:30.524 --> 00:50:31.994
I see.

00:50:33.054 --> 00:50:34.224
Mister,

00:50:34.624 --> 00:50:37.124
you reminded me of my dad for three seconds.

00:50:37.794 --> 00:50:40.064
That's what brought me here to chat with you.

00:50:40.794 --> 00:50:42.933
You just have to follow the demolition team leader's orders.

00:50:42.934 --> 00:50:44.263
- It'll be tough, but... - Goodness.

00:50:44.264 --> 00:50:45.503
Ms. Ji.

00:50:45.504 --> 00:50:46.734
You're here.

00:50:48.274 --> 00:50:51.714
My gosh, thank you for letting us work with you again.

00:50:52.044 --> 00:50:53.344
It's a pleasure to see you.

00:50:53.614 --> 00:50:56.783
Please do a neat job, as you did last time.

00:50:56.784 --> 00:50:57.843
Of course.

00:50:57.844 --> 00:50:59.153
By the way, please greet each other.

00:50:59.154 --> 00:51:00.253
This is Mr. Lee Sang Cheol.

00:51:00.254 --> 00:51:02.723
Meet the demolition team leader and his crew.

00:51:02.724 --> 00:51:05.394
- Hello. - The pleasure is mine.

00:51:06.694 --> 00:51:08.663
You have to tear everything out,

00:51:08.664 --> 00:51:10.363
but I put up instructions on the wall just in case.

00:51:10.364 --> 00:51:12.133
The gas and water pipes have been turned off.

00:51:12.134 --> 00:51:14.063
You don't have to remind me.

00:51:14.064 --> 00:51:15.963
Pull out some beverages and get going.

00:51:15.964 --> 00:51:17.303
You don't want to get covered in dust.

00:51:17.304 --> 00:51:18.334
Sure.

00:51:18.674 --> 00:51:20.004
Let's head inside.

00:51:24.844 --> 00:51:27.374
Sir, don't wear a thin mask like that.

00:51:28.844 --> 00:51:30.083
Wear a dustproof mask instead.

00:51:30.084 --> 00:51:31.784
Oh, I see. Thanks.

00:51:32.984 --> 00:51:35.224
We're here to work on Unit 702.

00:51:37.054 --> 00:51:38.154
Off we go.

00:51:38.694 --> 00:51:41.223
Come on. You don't have to go upstairs.

00:51:41.224 --> 00:51:42.263
I won't be staying for long.

00:51:42.264 --> 00:51:43.764
I need to meet a client anyway.

00:51:44.094 --> 00:51:45.693
The bearing walls have been marked.

00:51:45.694 --> 00:51:47.094
You don't have to remind me.

00:52:08.154 --> 00:52:09.853
I'll get going, then.

00:52:09.854 --> 00:52:11.853
- Keep up the good work. - Have a good day.

00:52:11.854 --> 00:52:12.954
Have a good one.

00:52:19.464 --> 00:52:21.094
Director Ko.

00:52:22.004 --> 00:52:24.104
It's been a while, Ms. Ji.

00:52:24.204 --> 00:52:27.104
That was wrong of me, wasn't it? I've been absent.

00:52:27.204 --> 00:52:30.544
Hardly. You said you were busy.

00:52:30.604 --> 00:52:31.844
I've been working on other projects anyway.

00:52:32.974 --> 00:52:34.274
- Let's sit. - Sure.

00:52:39.054 --> 00:52:40.254
It's good to see you.

00:52:41.254 --> 00:52:42.424
Likewise.

00:52:45.524 --> 00:52:48.294
The four drafts you came up with helped clear my mind.

00:52:48.824 --> 00:52:50.194
Really? How so?

00:52:50.624 --> 00:52:52.663
The studio's art gallery...

00:52:52.664 --> 00:52:54.433
should accommodate two painters...

00:52:54.434 --> 00:52:56.803
and one stationery designer or product designer.

00:52:56.804 --> 00:52:58.774
I thought at least three artists could share the space.

00:52:59.334 --> 00:53:02.043
Metal craft has its flair, though the work can be noisy.

00:53:02.044 --> 00:53:04.504
Besides, the space might be too cramped to share.

00:53:05.214 --> 00:53:07.673
Even ordinary people, let alone artists,

00:53:07.674 --> 00:53:09.884
need adequate distance from one another.

00:53:10.344 --> 00:53:11.344
Sure.

00:53:12.014 --> 00:53:13.213
If there are two painters,

00:53:13.214 --> 00:53:14.814
couldn't the walls serve as space to display artwork?

00:53:15.484 --> 00:53:16.524
Of course.

00:53:16.884 --> 00:53:18.054
I've been meaning to ask.

00:53:18.894 --> 00:53:20.853
Have you ever considered...

00:53:20.854 --> 00:53:22.264
letting the public watch the artists at work?

00:53:22.824 --> 00:53:24.663
Even if glass walls must be added,

00:53:24.664 --> 00:53:26.933
giving people a chance to see artists at work...

00:53:26.934 --> 00:53:27.964
might be a charming experience.

00:53:28.664 --> 00:53:31.504
I should ask the artists who wish to work there.

00:53:31.574 --> 00:53:33.403
It could be distracting for them.

00:53:33.404 --> 00:53:35.573
Still, it could be a good idea...

00:53:35.574 --> 00:53:36.874
for stationery and product designers.

00:53:38.104 --> 00:53:40.613
Then, the first order of business would be to decide...

00:53:40.614 --> 00:53:41.714
which artists to support.

00:53:43.084 --> 00:53:44.113
Actually,

00:53:44.114 --> 00:53:46.314
I'd like us to choose the mood first.

00:53:49.884 --> 00:53:51.223
I saw the space in a magazine,

00:53:51.224 --> 00:53:52.994
and the interior design caught my eye.

00:53:55.194 --> 00:53:58.394
Simple and not too complicated, but also warm.

00:54:01.634 --> 00:54:03.204
That's exactly what I thought.

00:54:13.214 --> 00:54:14.214
Hold on.

00:54:26.794 --> 00:54:28.294
Do you like glass art?

00:54:30.394 --> 00:54:32.333
I like items...

00:54:32.334 --> 00:54:34.794
that add charm to a space.

00:54:35.804 --> 00:54:36.903
You're right.

00:54:36.904 --> 00:54:38.574
I guess you were drawn here.

00:54:39.604 --> 00:54:41.974
I was. It's beautiful.

00:54:43.874 --> 00:54:46.614
I'd like to ask you something.

00:54:47.674 --> 00:54:48.684
Actually,

00:54:49.344 --> 00:54:50.484
I'd like to make a guess.

00:54:51.814 --> 00:54:52.814
Sorry?

00:54:53.784 --> 00:54:55.684
I doubt it's from working on a site,

00:54:56.124 --> 00:54:58.824
and it can't be boy trouble since you said you were single.

00:55:00.924 --> 00:55:03.794
So why do I see exhaustion in your eyes?

00:55:04.464 --> 00:55:07.834
Or should I say they seem filled with chaos?

00:55:08.434 --> 00:55:09.734
That's what I see.

00:55:10.134 --> 00:55:11.674
It's what I noticed the day we first met.

00:55:14.034 --> 00:55:15.303
I'm sorry.

00:55:15.304 --> 00:55:17.203
I must not have seemed focused.

00:55:17.204 --> 00:55:18.773
Gosh, don't apologise.

00:55:18.774 --> 00:55:20.714
I'm just telling you what I saw.

00:55:21.114 --> 00:55:22.414
In brief moments,

00:55:23.414 --> 00:55:25.214
I sensed self-blame.

00:55:32.194 --> 00:55:33.454
There's someone...

00:55:34.124 --> 00:55:35.464
I hate,

00:55:36.094 --> 00:55:37.664
someone who seriously wronged me.

00:55:38.664 --> 00:55:41.734
He turned out to be the kind of person I loathe.

00:55:42.764 --> 00:55:45.873
I tend to be generous toward people...

00:55:45.874 --> 00:55:47.574
in difficult situations,

00:55:49.504 --> 00:55:52.914
but I haven't been able to, and it must have taken a toll on me.

00:55:55.284 --> 00:55:56.344
Then,

00:55:57.014 --> 00:55:58.654
be generous to that person.

00:55:59.154 --> 00:56:00.154
Just be nicer.

00:56:02.254 --> 00:56:04.424
You can't bring yourself to be cruel to this person.

00:56:07.124 --> 00:56:09.394
It's someone you can't hate entirely.

00:56:12.964 --> 00:56:14.034
Excuse me.

00:56:14.264 --> 00:56:15.264
Yes?

00:56:20.274 --> 00:56:22.003
This isn't necessary, Director Ko.

00:56:22.004 --> 00:56:23.473
This is more than I can accept.

00:56:23.474 --> 00:56:25.073
How can you know if this is too expensive?

00:56:25.074 --> 00:56:26.714
It didn't even have a price tag.

00:56:26.874 --> 00:56:29.944
I'm aware of the artist.

00:56:30.384 --> 00:56:31.484
Really?

00:56:31.984 --> 00:56:33.983
Now, I'm really glad I bought it.

00:56:33.984 --> 00:56:36.354
I got you a gift you'll love.

00:56:36.954 --> 00:56:38.624
I should be complimented for that.

00:56:39.524 --> 00:56:40.894
Still, it's too much.

00:56:41.524 --> 00:56:44.864
Does this look like a gift to you?

00:56:45.134 --> 00:56:46.734
Do you think I'm giving you a gift?

00:56:48.294 --> 00:56:49.434
What is it, then?

00:56:50.904 --> 00:56:52.104
It's courage.

00:56:53.804 --> 00:56:55.474
I'm giving you courage.

00:56:56.144 --> 00:56:57.673
I want to give you words of encouragement,

00:56:57.674 --> 00:56:59.144
but words have no power.

00:56:59.514 --> 00:57:01.274
That's why I'm giving you this.

00:57:01.474 --> 00:57:02.483
So that you'd find the courage...

00:57:02.484 --> 00:57:05.014
and return to who you used to be.

00:57:06.714 --> 00:57:09.984
That way, you'll be able to focus better on my project.

00:57:13.354 --> 00:57:16.824
The joy of gifts lies more in giving than receiving.

00:57:18.834 --> 00:57:19.864
Here.

00:57:24.404 --> 00:57:25.474
Then,

00:57:26.774 --> 00:57:27.834
I'll accept this.

00:57:28.604 --> 00:57:30.504
Thank you so much, Director Ko.

Gang Oh.

00:57:40.914 --> 00:57:42.653
What's wrong with you today?

00:57:42.654 --> 00:57:44.523
You're all over the place.

00:57:44.524 --> 00:57:45.853
You got the table number wrong...

00:57:45.854 --> 00:57:47.454
and made a mistake while receiving a take-out order.

00:57:48.294 --> 00:57:49.424
Are you not feeling well?

00:57:50.524 --> 00:57:51.594
You see,

00:57:52.094 --> 00:57:54.463
my stomach's been in pain, Mom.

00:57:54.464 --> 00:57:56.503
What? Your stomach?

00:57:56.504 --> 00:57:57.633
What's wrong?

00:57:57.634 --> 00:57:59.904
- Do you need to see a doctor? - No, it's not that bad.

00:58:01.174 --> 00:58:03.274
But I could use some rest at home.

00:58:03.504 --> 00:58:05.444
Can you call the part-timer for the evening shift?

00:58:05.744 --> 00:58:06.843
Will resting be enough?

00:58:06.844 --> 00:58:08.484
- I'll stop by the pharmacy. - But...

00:58:31.104 --> 00:58:32.373
Your sister...

00:58:32.374 --> 00:58:35.374
should meet someone nice and settle down soon.

00:58:35.904 --> 00:58:37.373
Not even a woman these days can get married...

00:58:37.374 --> 00:58:38.444
without a penny to her name.

00:58:39.044 --> 00:58:40.344
Of course not.

00:58:41.214 --> 00:58:42.844
I know it. It's here.

Mom has money saved up for Eun Oh.

The closet is the safest spot.

A stack of expired bank books indicates...

00:59:29.994 --> 00:59:32.334
an 87.5 percent chance of money being here.

00:59:37.934 --> 00:59:40.434
What's this? It's from when Dad died.

00:59:41.274 --> 00:59:43.744
Why does she still have the form for renouncing inheritance?

00:59:46.374 --> 00:59:47.913
Mom must be afraid...

00:59:47.914 --> 00:59:49.784
that creditors will come after us again.

00:59:50.844 --> 00:59:54.084

Oh, no. Sir.

01:00:36.694 --> 01:00:37.923
Sir.

01:00:37.924 --> 01:00:39.934
- Oh, no. What do I do? Sir. - Shoot.

01:00:46.774 --> 01:00:47.774
Darn you.

01:00:50.574 --> 01:00:53.274
Get out. Get out of the car!

01:00:53.614 --> 01:00:54.943
Have you lost your mind?

01:00:54.944 --> 01:00:56.783
Did you see it happen? Do you have proof?

It's on your dashcam!

01:00:58.484 --> 01:00:59.814

We can't go through because of you. Who are you anyway?

An old man's on the ground over there. It's a hit-and-run.

01:01:17.264 --> 01:01:18.973
She's right. Get out of the car.

01:01:18.974 --> 01:01:20.303
It's a hit-and-run. Please help.

01:01:20.304 --> 01:01:22.003
I called the police. Hop out, mister.

01:01:22.004 --> 01:01:24.874
- Did you see it happen? - There's an old man on the ground.

01:01:25.204 --> 01:01:26.414
Get out already.

Why are you here so early, Ms. Ji?

She's so stubborn. It's so annoying.

You're not their birth daughter!

01:03:43.484 --> 01:03:46.154
You bullied me all this time, knowing we weren't even related?

01:03:46.284 --> 01:03:47.413
Who are you people?

01:03:47.414 --> 01:03:48.984
