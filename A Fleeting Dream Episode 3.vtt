00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.259
I'll do it myself.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.518
Don't be stubborn.
If you don't treat it right,

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:25.219
it'll leave a scar.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.499
Close your eyes.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.620
Close my eyes?

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.440
How am I supposed
to put on the medicine?

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:34.899
Or...

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.060
Just turn your face away.

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:36.659
This time,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.340
I was careless.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.140
It's not your fault.

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.459
None of us expected

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.740
Pei Yujie to strike out like that.

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:48.419
Good thing they see me
as a sickly weakling,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.180
or things would've been much worse
for us in the Pei family.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.139
But with your back like this,

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.299
the plan with the Lian family
might have to be postponed.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.580
No.

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.379
I've waited five years for this day.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.300
Far too long.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.780
I don't want to wait
even a single day more.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.180
I never expected you
would come to play chess with me.

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.579
Father said you're an excellent player.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.220
I would like to learn from you.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.340
But you're clearly not focused.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.820
Xueshan.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.140
Are you keeping something from me?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.460
No.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.660
Of course no.

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.639
Jiang Yao, why are you here again?

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.620
Still putting on a show in front of me,

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:21.779
Xinruo?

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.299
I've told you many times.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.700
I'm not Lian Xinruo.

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:26.919
Stop pestering me.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.719
Xinruo, you don't have
to be so guarded with me.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.558
The Pei family isn't
as simple as you think.

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:35.100
You want to use Pei Yuze's power
to take back the Lian family, that's impossible.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.959
If you really want to reclaim
the Lian family, I can help,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.660
but now is not the right time.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.679
Trust me.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.620
I...

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:47.919
Jiang Yao, it seems my warning

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.479
meant nothing to you.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.679
Uncle Yuze, don't blame Yao.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.879
It was my idea.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.299
I recognized Du...

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.518
I recognized Du Xinruo

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:57.099
by her birthmark.

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:00.038
Xinruo, we mean no harm.

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.758
Yao just wants to talk to you,

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.299
that's why I drew Uncle Yuze away.

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:06.459
Birthmark?

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.278
What birthmark?

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.340
What are you talking about?
I don't get it.

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:11.819
How could that be?

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.999
I clearly saw the birthmark
on your lower back.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.220
Lower back?

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:26.499
Everyone abroad
knows the singer Meng Die,

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.439
but here in Hu City,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.860
nobody does.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.500
And you compare me to some courtesans?
What a bunch of bumpkins.

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:40.059
This farce is over.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.399
Uncle Yuze, Miss Du.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.380
Sorry, I got you wrong.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.380
Wait.

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.379
Apologize.

00:05:51.359 --> 00:05:53.179
I'm sorry, Uncle Yuze.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.259
Miss Du.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.879
I didn't mean to offend.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.100
Miss Du?

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.820
I'm sorry.

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:03.579
Aunt Youmeng.

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:06.899
I didn't mean to offend.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.100
Uncle Yuze, Aunt Youmeng, I'm sorry.

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:13.219
Pei Yuze.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.439
It's about time.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.540
Get ready.

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.899
Master, here, take your medicine.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.358
The Lian Manor is so big.

00:06:35.359 --> 00:06:37.758
And no one's here to greet guests?

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.038
Second Master, Miss Du.

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:39.979
Here.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.479
Life, huh...

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.660
Just a few days ago,
Mr. Lian was full of vigor.

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:50.118
And now he's like this.

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:52.939
Truly, life is unpredictable.

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:57.019
The Lian Manor is so desolate.

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:59.699
No one's come to visit Mr. Lian
all these days.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.260
Seems like
Mr. Lian's not that well-liked.

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.419
Yuze, you may not know yet.

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:08.499
After what happened to Mr. Lian,

00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:12.539
several of his concubines
ran off overnight with their wealth.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.500
Not a trace of loyalty.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.259
I heard they still haven't caught
the attacker.

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.118
Mr. Lian has too many enemies.

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:25.900
There are no leads even now.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.220
I guess this matter

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:30.479
will likely just fade away.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.798
So, you see.

00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:34.358
People like Mr. Lian,
who've caused so much harm,

00:07:34.359 --> 00:07:36.239
deserve it.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.220
The entire Hu City is applauding.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.140
Mr. Lian.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.860
Here, take your medicine.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.220
Butler.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.060
Yes, Master.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.340
Mr. Lian spat out the medicine.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.660
Come on, help me change his clothes.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.959
How could I trouble you with this?

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.359
It's okay. Just a small favor.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.179
Master.

00:08:07.359 --> 00:08:08.299
Master.

00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:39.339
Lian...

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.979
Lian Xinruo?

00:08:45.239 --> 00:08:48.318
You must be Miss Xinya.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.838
You've mistaken me for someone else.
My name is Du Youmeng.

00:08:50.839 --> 00:08:52.539
I am Pei Yuze's fiancée.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.660
Du Youmeng?

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.260
My father collapsed
at your engagement ceremony.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.180
No, you are Lian Xinruo.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.798
You came back for revenge.

00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:06.198
Revenge? What do you mean?

00:09:06.199 --> 00:09:09.079
Is Lian Xinruo's death
connected to you and your father?

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.740
What does it have to do with me?

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.439
That girl jumped into the sea herself.
It has nothing to do with me.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.100
Miss Xinya, you don't need to explain.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.580
It's none of my business either.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.580
Stop right there.

00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:27.379
And what advice do you have for me,
Miss Xinya?

00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:30.358
My father's paralyzed,

00:09:30.359 --> 00:09:32.699
yet you sneak into my room.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.758
You're here to steal
our family treasure, aren't you?

00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:37.519
I don't even know the way
around your house.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.980
I was looking for the restroom
and took a wrong turn.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.820
Why make such a fuss?

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.358
I've seen plenty of shallow courtesans
like you.

00:09:46.359 --> 00:09:49.299
Don't think being tied to the Pei family
will protect you.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.020
Guards!

00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:51.838
Miss.

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:52.819
Search her.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.820
Wait.

00:09:54.199 --> 00:09:57.259
At the very least, today I am still
a guest of the Lian family.

00:09:57.359 --> 00:09:59.999
If you search me and find nothing
belonging to your family,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.380
how will you explain yourself?

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:05.299
Here in the Lian Manor, I am the law.

00:10:05.319 --> 00:10:06.838
If you refuse to be searched today,

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:08.699
you will not leave this manor.

00:10:09.319 --> 00:10:10.459
Fine.

00:10:11.359 --> 00:10:12.339
Search me if you want.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.719
Then you do it yourself.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.739
All right.

00:10:21.319 --> 00:10:22.579
You're hiding it in there.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.580
What are you standing around for? Do it.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.940
Miss Lian.

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:39.060
We came out of kindness to visit,
yet you deliberately make things difficult.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.179
Are you trying to make an enemy
of the Pei family?

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:43.419
Pei Yuze.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.119
Just because your family's influential
in Hu City

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.020
doesn't mean you can run wild
in the Lian Manor.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.820
You're nothing more
than a powerless heir.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:53.659
You really think I'm afraid of you?

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:59.099
I'll remember what happened today.

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:02.179
One day, I'll return the favor
with a big gift.

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:10.979
Useless!

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:12.819
Go.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.940
Don't touch the one named Pei.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.500
Teach this woman a lesson.

00:11:41.319 --> 00:11:42.419
You've got a fever.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.060
Is your wound infected?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.839
I just had a bit of a headache
this morning.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.079
I'll be fine after some rest.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.300
I'll go buy you some medicine.
