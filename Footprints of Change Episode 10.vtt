[Footprints of Change]

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.729
[Episode 10]

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.229
Hungry?

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.830
Haven't had dinner?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.580
I'm not in the mood.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.010
Guess the talk didn't go well.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.160
Tell me about it.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.520
They really have no idea

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.180
about the Japanese
strength and capabilities.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.860
Do you think...

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.270
my dad was really
killed by the Japanese?

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.480
We've got plenty of men,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.750
but we're no match for the Japanese.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.290
Pistols are no match for machine guns.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.800
That warlord Zhang in the northeast—

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.930
wasn't he powerful?

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.970
Didn't he still get killed
by the Japanese bomb?

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.190
Now Master just

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.710
got a new son late in life.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.190
In his mind, he's still

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.080
some hot-blooded young guy.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.070
We need to splash some cold water on him

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.030
to distract him.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.350
Once his energy is diverted,

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.110
he won't have time
for the workers' strike.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.680
How do we do it?

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.190
No way.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.880
That's my brother.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.480
"Boiling beans on beanstalks—

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.730
the beans weep, burned by their own kind."

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.940
I'll take all of these.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.200
Wrap them up for me.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.860
Madam Yanhong.

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:50.870
Siyun.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.870
Waitress,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.070
bring me your most expensive necklace.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.720
Who is this?

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.380
This is my sister-in-law.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.240
Madam Yanhong.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.320
Bring me another expensive one.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.000
Here, Siyun.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.340
This is for you.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.800
The other one is for your sister-in-law.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.750
You've helped me a lot

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.360
with my baby's matters.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.380
Thank you, Madam Yanhong.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.780
I can't accept this gift.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.030
I provided medical treatment.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.120
Mr. Zeng has already
paid the consultation fee.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.390
That's not the same.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.950
Even though he's paid you,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.829
this is my gift.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.829
Please take it.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.200
It's not that expensive.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.060
I really can't.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.160
I will keep

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.460
your baby in mind.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.320
Alright, I won't force you then.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.870
Once my baby's born,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.270
I'll prepare a proper gift for you.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.860
You must accept it then.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.520
Siyun,

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.630
let me tell you,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.870
all those little ailments I had before,

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.830
they've vanished.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.750
I guess that's what they call
"good news brings good health."

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.810
Congratulations.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.040
I know what you're thinking.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.680
That I only married the old man for money.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.790
Or what else?

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.310
Of course I'm in it for the money.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.640
Isn't it good to be rich?

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.630
With money,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.510
I can buy whatever I want.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.920
My child and I

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.600
can live a good life.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.130
That's why

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.980
a woman

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.500
has to be shrewd.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.680
I didn't have a choice.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.950
So if I had to choose—I'd choose money.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.190
Siyun,

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.920
do you think my baby

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.430
will be a boy or a girl?

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.160
That I can't tell.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.990
Can traditional medicine predict it?

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.460
I don't know.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.120
What if it's a girl—

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.600
does that mean less money for me?

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.750
Forget it. I won't think about it.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.770
I'll just burn incense every day

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.520
when I get back to pray for a boy.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.240
Alright, I should go now.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.880
Take good care of yourself, Madam Yanhong.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.680
Okay, I won't see you out.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.270
My belly is getting bigger.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.159
I need to buy more new clothes.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.120
Let's go, Sis.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.409
It was this necklace just now, right?

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.380
Siyun,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.120
it's such a nice necklace.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.520
Why didn't you accept it?

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.000
Taking gifts from others is a burden.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.200
It doesn't feel easy.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.770
Then here's an idea.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.010
Next time you

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.870
treat those rich ladies,

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.080
take me with you.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.380
You might feel awkward, but I don't.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.780
I'll accept them for you.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.190
Dr. Lin! Dr. Lin!

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.680
Come with me quickly!

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.140
Madam Yanhong's not good!

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.170
What happened?

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.900
Madam Yanhong,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.720
what's wrong?

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.830
My belly hurts.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.480
I just bled.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.310
Do you think I'll be alright?

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.000
Fu,

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.060
call a car.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.950
We're going to the hospital.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:33.510
Okay.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.600
Sis, I'll accompany
Madam Yanhong to the hospital.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.630
You call the hospital

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.190
and tell them to prepare for surgery.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.600
Also,

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.940
notify Cheng Ao to come to the hospital.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.659
Alright.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.800
Relax.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.310
Give the patient a blood transfusion.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.190
Call the anesthetist.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.450
Get ready for surgery.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.120
Am I going to die?

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.640
No.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.890
Don't be nervous.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:22.800
Take deep breaths.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.160
We'll give you blood.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.420
Once the anesthetic's in, it won't hurt.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.870
Director,

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.390
maybe you should step out.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.850
People outside
are insisting on seeing you.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.220
I'll step out for a moment.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.620
I'll be right back
to perform your surgery.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.070
Dr. Lin.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.070
Siyun,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.240
what's going on?

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.040
When I was at the department store today,

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.670
I ran into Madam Yanhong.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.310
She suddenly felt unwell.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.070
After examination, we found out

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.270
she's showing signs of miscarriage.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.070
But...

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.270
she was fine
when she left home this morning.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.870
How could this happen?

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.470
She's still hemorrhaging.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.870
The situation is critical.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.000
What about the baby?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.560
Answer him!

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.330
I'm sorry, Dr. Lin.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.290
Please go ahead.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.260
We can only save

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.340
either the baby or the mother.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:41.720
Yanhong.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.040
Save the mother.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.930
Wait.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.000
Dr. Lin,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.820
save the baby instead.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.450
Here's a small gift.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.530
Thank you for your help.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.210
Director, her blood pressure is dropping.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.120
Almost unmeasurable.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.360
If we force delivery,

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.510
we might not be able to save the mother.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:58.130
[Emergency Room]

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:12.770
Is it a boy or girl?

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.880
Madam Yanhong's condition

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.120
has stabilized.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.030
What about the baby?

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.150
The baby...

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.700
didn't make it.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.390
What did I just tell you?

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.710
I am a doctor.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.600
I had no choice.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.490
Didn't you say there was a choice?

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.600
Father.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.320
Get out of the way!

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.150
Something's wrong here.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.020
We need to investigate first.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.850
Move!

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.170
Take him away!

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.200
Get out of here!

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:01.900
Father!

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.950
Father, I beg you.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.000
Father, don't shoot.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.190
Father!

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.060
Father, you can't shoot!

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:08.890
Father!

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.030
Father, you can't kill her!

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.460
Father!

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.770
Father!

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:17.670
Father!

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.220
Father!

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.960
Father!

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.270
Father!

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.200
Father!

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.550
Cheng Ao,

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.930
from today on,

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.270
your 20-year relationship
with our Zeng family

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.630
is over.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:42.890
Are you okay?

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:46.390
I'm fine.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.190
Yanhong will recover, right?

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.990
She's not even 20 yet.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.860
Her body should recover quickly.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.870
She can have children again.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.750
That's good.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.000
I'm sorry.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.410
What are you sorry for?

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.620
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.150
If it were me,

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.450
I would've chosen the same.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.180
I just find it all
so sudden and bewildering.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.270
Dalun suddenly

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.970
started working with the Japanese.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.900
My father

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.240
suddenly cut ties with me.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.870
I used to think

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.030
I could handle many things,

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.480
face all kinds of situations.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.590

I just don't know what to do.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.590

and been deceived.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:35.590

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.160

back then,

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.090

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.750

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.600
when are you free

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.960
these next few days?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.360
When are you free?

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.200
What's up?

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.920
I want to treat you to dinner.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.960
My treat—you set it up.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.190
I'm busy.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.840
Do you know who contacted me?

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.600
Zeng Dalun.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.850
He's doing really well now.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.320
And what's that

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:00.910
got to do with me?

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.270
You're close with Cheng Ao,
and he's close with Dalun.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.000
Help me set up

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:08.400
a dinner with him.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.790
If I could work with him,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.480
wouldn't our family be better off again?

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.880
You know,

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.920
Zeng Dalun is quite influential now.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.640
He's very close with the Japanese.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:25.359
With the current situation

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.740
being so tense,

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:31.030
if I could connect
with the Japanese through Zeng Dalun,

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.840
wouldn't that be
double insurance for our family?

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.850
I understand better than anyone

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.650
what it means
to adapt to changing circumstances.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.280
Please leave immediately.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.050
If you don't leave now,
I'll call the police.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.440
You know me well enough.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.590
Dalun,

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.960
the investigation into Communist supplies

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.750
is now in its final stage.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.720
Most of Shanghai's docks
have been checked.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.680
Now I want to inspect your family's dock.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.720
Our dock?

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.160
No way.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.270
My father isn't pro-Communist.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.800
He only hates the Japanese.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.240
Dalun,

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.680
your opium trafficking

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.270
has been reported to the higher-ups.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.500
Cooperating with Shen Yiqun this time

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.890
is your chance to make amends.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.000
Cooperate?

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.480
Why should I cooperate with Shen Yiqun?

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.740
Who does he think he is?

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.750
I've done

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.790
more work for the Revival Society

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.850
than he has lately.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:02.550
Dalun,

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.880
it's good for young people
to have passion.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.680
But politics isn't just about fighting.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.630
What matters most is brains.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.000
I understand.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.400
So according to you,

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.790
the deputy director position
is basically Shen Yiqun's?

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.030
Not necessarily.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.790
You might still have a shot.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:43.270
What's crucial now is whether we can seize

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.270
that shipment of medicine
the Communists are moving out of Shanghai.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.590
If you can track down this shipment,

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.250
the deputy director position

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.790
should be yours.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.600
Just bear with it for now.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.400
Having you work with Shen Yiqun

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.200
is also what our superiors want.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.630
Thank you for your guidance, Director.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.010
That's more like it.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.300
Remember this,

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.120
the grievance

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.490
is just a temporary thing.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.550
I have high hopes for you.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.310
Do your best.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:11.830
I'll get to it.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:13.320
Go on then.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:21.720
Cut back on smoking.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.600
Thank you, Director.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.140
Jin,

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.750
set up a meeting with Mr. Sada for me.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.750
Tell him

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.180
I need to see him urgently.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.640
Seems Director Liu's words
can't be trusted.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.310
I've never trusted him anyway.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:47.510
So, what's your plan?

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.680
Take this carton of cigarettes.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.780
Thank you, Young Master.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.590
Mr. Sada,

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.440
we've worked together for a long time—

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.720
from the Northeast to Shanghai.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.520
Our business dealings
have always gone smoothly.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.450
That's true.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.760
Let's drink to our friendship.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.270
I have an idea

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.240
that not only keeps our business going,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.700
but also strengthens
my cooperation with the Empire of Japan.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.070
Mr. Zeng,

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.250
we've been friends for years.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.320
Of course I'd welcome deeper cooperation.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.210
But may I ask,

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.400
how exactly do you plan

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.240
to achieve this?

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.510
Shen Yiqun and I

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.960
are competing for
the deputy director position.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.550
You know what kind
of person Shen Yiqun is.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.070
He has always been anti-Japanese.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.000
If he becomes the deputy director,

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.440
it would certainly

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.100
be all harm and no good for you.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.590
But if it's me,

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:53.940
the Kuomintang's door

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.420
would be your back door.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.550
Whatever intelligence you need,

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:58.920
I can easily provide.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.590
That's thoughtful of you, Mr. Zeng.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.390
Since you've spoken so frankly,

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.530
we will definitely help you win

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.810
this position.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.750
I will do my utmost.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.110
Mr. Gu,

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.610
you wanted to see me?

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.790
The contact I usually work with
has been arrested.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.270
The situation is extremely urgent.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.200
Both the medicine and myself
need to be transferred.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.240
I'll make arrangements.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:39.960
Be careful.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.170
It's so late.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.730
I just finished a meeting.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:55.990
The meeting was about

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.590
deploying forces throughout the city
to eliminate the Communists.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.720
Our principle is
to capture them alive if possible,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.320
but shoot to kill
at the slightest resistance.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.080
Why are you telling me this?

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.220
You know this person well, don't you?

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.100
He's on our elimination list.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.940
Once he's captured...

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.830
I don't know if you're familiar

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.490
with our torture procedures,

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.540
but no one can withstand them.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.240
Within 3 days, he will definitely reveal

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.770
everyone connected to him.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.410
Aren't you afraid saying this

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.030
will get you in trouble?

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.110
I have no choice.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.270
Here are two steamer tickets.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.980
Take Siyun and leave Shanghai.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.910
Go to Chongqing.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.160
I'll think about it.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.510
Cheng Ao,

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.010
just think it through.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.150
Make your decision quickly.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.050
I'm leaving.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.810
Why such a hurry?

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.200
Stay for a drink.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.240
Another time—

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.840
once things settle down.

[Law Firm File]

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.950
Why did you suddenly ask me to meet here?

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.730
When I'm working,

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.850
it's all so fake.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.590
After so many years in politics,

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.110
meeting different people every day,

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.850
saying different things to everyone,

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:28.920
sometimes I don't even know

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.440
if what I'm doing is right or wrong.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.840
It's just so exhausting.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.170
This place is nice.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:34.550
It helps me relax.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:37.990
Have you ever thought

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.400
it's your own ambition

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.290
that's turned you into this?

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.370
My ambition is big, yes.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.100
But who doesn't have ambition?

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.720
I've tried to control it—

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.680
but I can't.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.070
This is for you.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:55.790
A gift.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.070
I bought a house in Chongqing
for you and Cheng Ao.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.200
I've seen the house. It's really nice.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:02.920
You love dogs, right?

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.830
The yard is perfect for that.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.420
And don't feel pressured.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.880
Both your names are on the deed.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.200
You know what I mean.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.030
I'm suggesting that you could

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.560
leave Shanghai for a while.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.900
It's so dangerous now,
bullets flying every day.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.560
What if one day a bullet, bang!

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.640
I'm not saying it would hit you.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.400
But what if it hits Cheng Ao's head?

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.800
That would be terrible. I'd be devastated.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.000
No one is get shot.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.030
That's good.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.440
What's good?

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.000
You're so good to Cheng Ao.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.440
Take it.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.380
I can't accept this house.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.800
Why not?

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.640
Why should I?

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.960
Does Cheng Ao know about this?

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.110
I just went to see him.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.830
I told him about it.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:52.550
He knows.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.920
Alright, I'm not teasing you anymore.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.960
I didn't buy this house for you two.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:59.310
I just helped you pick it.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.590
I paid on your behalf.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:01.880
Just now in Cheng Ao's office,

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.270
he already paid me back.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.680
And honestly, it's pretty expensive.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.540
I might not even afford it myself.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.940
Cheng Ao treats you

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.840
really well.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.430
Now you can accept it, right?

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.440
I've had a lock specially made.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.790
Here's the key.

When things settle down someday,

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.160
I'll come visit you in Chongqing.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.200
But promise me—

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.060
save me a room.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:41.750
Don't turn me away when I come.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.320
Alright, you go home first.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.910
I'll stay here a bit longer.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:00.830
Wait.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Be happy!

Young Master,

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.980
we didn't find Cheng Ao's medicine.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.690
That's impossible.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.390
Yes, sir!

Zhi,

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.660
where did you

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.020
get this deed from?

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.680
I'll count to three.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:43.480
One—

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:45.920
Two—

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920
I'll tell you.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.740
Zhi has confessed that

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.680
Zeng Dalun gave her money

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:53.720
and a property deed

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.560
to put abortion medicine

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.720
into Madam Yanhong's chicken soup.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:01.990
I see.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:03.310
You may go now.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:05.980
Dr. Lin,

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.110
please have a seat.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:21.110
The other day,

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.380
you were frightened.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.450
I'm truly sorry about that.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.240
Lately, I've been thinking about

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.440
Cheng Ao

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.330
and Dalun when they were children.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.870
Those two boys

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.000
always loved running around
in the courtyard

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.240
back and forth,

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.950
never sitting still.

A child’s nature shows the adult to come.

Dalun has

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
been mischievous since childhood.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.960
As for Ao,

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.310
he has always been very steady.

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.200
Dr. Lin,

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.790
can you forgive me?

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.400
Here's a small gift from me.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:37.680
Please don't refuse it.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:57.420
Take it.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.340
It's from Father.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:19.960
Dad,

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:21.980
I did it,

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.840
but it was to protect you.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:27.480
Dad,

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:29.350
have you seen Cheng Ao?

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:30.920
Do you want him dead too?

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:31.880
Dad,

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.110
how could I?

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.460
You and Cheng Ao
are the closest people to me.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:38.000
Ao has a shipment of goods.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.040
If you give me that shipment,

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.510
I will get promoted.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.440
By then, what's mine

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.730
will be yours and Cheng Ao's too.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:51.400
Go!

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.360
I'll say this one last time.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.100
No dealings with the Japanese.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:24.030
The medicines and equipment
are all packed.

Ready to depart anytime.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.840
Mr. Cheng,

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:30.760
I hope one day

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.360
you will join us.

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:38.310
Those with determination

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.350
will eventually find their path

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.670
toward the right goal.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.260
Take care once you leave Shanghai.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.840

if there were more people like Mr. Gu,

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:38.040
our country would have hope, wouldn't it?

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.960
I believe so.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:41.860
We must strive to be like him.

disinfect and bandage them.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.760
Understood.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.950
I'm really smart, you know.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.590
Do you know what these mirrors

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:27.550
are for?

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.390
In a couple of days,

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:30.800
when Japanese planes come,

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.260
we'll place these mirrors

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.130
at the most important
National Army positions—

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.890
grain depots,

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:39.340
command posts,

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.630
and arsenals.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:44.040
When these mirrors reflect light,

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:45.320
the Japanese planes

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.040
will hit their targets with precision.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.000
This glass is quite sturdy.

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.670
Go break it.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:02.510
Okay.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:04.880
Nobody move!

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:06.480
Get down!

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:14.550
Stop right there!

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:48.550
Dad,

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.440
I'm negotiating with the Japanese,

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.840
trying for a ceasefire.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.850
They've agreed.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:59.070
As long as the National Army

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.530
withdraws from Shanghai,

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.630
they promised to treat our people well.
