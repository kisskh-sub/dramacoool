=Episode 7=

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:18.879
What's he doing here?

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.598
Jin Se and I will draw Jiang Yao away.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.838
You go get ready.

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:13.759
All right.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.199
(My father was framed!)

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.240
(There's no way
he could have killed Mr. Jiang!)

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.879
The daughter of a murderer dares
to cause trouble for the Pei family!

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.000
Shameless!

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.999
You're just deliberately stirring up trouble,
hoping Jiang Yao will change his mind.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.358
Like father, like daughter!

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:42.759
Disgusting and despicable!

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.719
Once you're dead,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.880
the Lian family will be mine.

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.480
(My father was framed!)

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.240
(- There's no way he could have killed Mr. Jiang!)
(- Murderer! Shameless!)

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.479
(Like father, like daughter!
Disgusting and despicable!)

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.199
Xinruo?

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.480
Xinruo!

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:38.159
Jin Se, distract Jiang Yao.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.680
Xinruo.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.760
Jiao Jiao?

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.239
Jiao Jiao.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.278
Jiao Jiao.

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:11.519
Father.

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.039
Father, ever since you're gone,

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.479
everyone's been bullying me.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.520
Jiao Jiao, don't be afraid.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.880
I will always be by your side.

00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:26.039
That's not true.

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:27.759
You're lying.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.879
You left me.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.360
I'll never see you again.

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.399
Jiao Jiao,

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.519
I'll always be in your heart.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.720
Remember this.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.960
As long as you keep me in your heart,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.640
my love for you will never disappear.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.640
Pei Yuze?

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:03.519
What happened to me?

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:08.839
Everything's all right now.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.960
I saw my father.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.720
He told me a lot of things.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.960
He...

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:19.639
Right.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.480
Where's Jiang Yao? Did Jiang Yao see us?

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.880
We've temporarily drawn him away.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.399
But he'll probably figure out

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.280
we're using a diversion soon.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.518
Time is tight.

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:32.119
We have to act immediately.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.440
This isn't good.

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:56.319
Lian Xinya.

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.439
Lian Xinruo, you came, after all...

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.959
You killed me.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.558
No, it wasn't me!

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:09.959
Wu Peirong did it.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.399
It was all Wu Peirong's idea!

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.319
You framed my father.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.598
It wasn't me. It was my father.

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:16.838
Where are you hiding my father?

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:18.518
I don't know! I don't know...

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:21.519
I didn't do it! Please let me go...

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.520
(Looks like she really doesn't know
about my father's situation.)

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:35.480
(Xinxin)

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.278
Don't lose hope. Even if Lian Xinya
doesn't know the truth,

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:45.039
we have other plans.

00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:46.559
I'm fine.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:50.680
It's just that my dissociative episodes have
never happened while I'm fully awake before.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.360
I'm worried it might affect our plans.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.040
I'll find a way to help you get better.

00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:00.559
We're almost at the cinema.
I'm going to change.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.000
Pei Yuze, look straight ahead.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:06.319
No turning back.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.120
Are you sure?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.360
Positive.

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:17.159
Second Master and Du Youmeng

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.838
left the cinema
as soon as the film ended.

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.639
Did you check inside along the way?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.798
There were guards at the entrance,

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:24.318
so...

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.359
Idiot!

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:27.518
I had a great time at the cinema.

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.318
Did you?

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:29.639
Then let's go again next time.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.160
Second Master, Xinruo, you're back late.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.758
I was busy the past few days.

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.119
I had the evening free tonight.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.078
Xinruo and I went

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:40.359
to see every new release.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.560
Oh, my.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.959
It is rather late.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.320
Oh, I heard "City of Angels"
just premiered today.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.159
Xueshan watched it this afternoon.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.199
She really liked

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.838
the lead actress's blue dress.

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:57.318
She told me to buy her one just like it.

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:59.919
You must be mistaken.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.320
I remember the lead's dress was red.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.240
It definitely was red.

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:07.319
I see.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.760
I must have misremembered.

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:11.879
It's late.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.159
You should get some rest too.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.420
(Pei Residence)

00:08:30.359 --> 00:08:32.999
Mr. Jiang, documents sent from abroad.

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:53.758
Why did you ask me to come?

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:57.039
I don't think Miss Xueshan
would be pleased if she saw us together.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.120
Miss Du.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.560
Please have a seat.

00:09:04.319 --> 00:09:05.439
Take a look at this.

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:18.718
You've been investigating me.

00:09:18.719 --> 00:09:20.079
I wouldn't have thought

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.280
you had plastic surgery five years ago.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.240
I'm curious,
what did you used to look like?

00:09:29.719 --> 00:09:32.318
I'm guessing you learned
about the Lian family's history,

00:09:32.319 --> 00:09:34.599
got their seal somehow,

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.318
and decided to pose as Lian Xinruo

00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:40.079
to claim the inheritance.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.638
To clear your path,

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:43.919
you went after
Lian Zhong and Lian Xinya.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.999
That's only your speculation.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.198
Do you have proof?

00:09:47.199 --> 00:09:49.760
The night of the thunderstorm,
I saw you at the Lian Residence.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.678
You impersonated Lian Xinruo
to scare Lian Xinya,

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:53.599
which left her mentally unstable now.

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:55.559
You deceived Uncle Yuze too.

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:58.278
I bet he's been lying for you too.

00:09:58.279 --> 00:09:59.919
And? What do you want?

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.640
Do you want to send me to the police?

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:03.439
You're overthinking it.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.718
No one's seen this document besides me.

00:10:05.719 --> 00:10:08.319
I called you here to discuss a deal.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.919
What do you want?

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.919
I want you to inherit the Lian family,

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.400
but you have to give me
half of what you inherit.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.200
You've got quite the appetite.

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:26.318
Likewise.

00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:27.479
Miss Du,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.919
do we

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.920
have

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.520
a deal?

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:39.639
Deal.

00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:42.319
Pleasure doing business
with you, Miss Du.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.758
Did you forge
that plastic surgery record?

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:56.119
Why did you do it?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.360
Look at this board.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.720
If you were playing white,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.879
what would be your next move?

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.679
Pei Yuze, I don't play chess.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.960
Even the best players

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.040
can't predict every move.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.000
But if we keep our opponent guessing,

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:21.879
we can find a chance to break
the deadlock while they hesitate.

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:24.599
Youmeng,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.720
I wasn't hiding things
from you on purpose.

00:11:28.839 --> 00:11:31.439
You're facing too many dangers.

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:34.319
I didn't want you distracted.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.599
You're setting a trap
only to lure Jiang Yao.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.838
But don't you know

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:41.158
he's using that to blackmail me,

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.239
demanding half the Lian family assets?

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.560
Jiang Yao thinks he's the player
controlling the game,

00:11:52.719 --> 00:11:54.079
but he hasn't earned

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:57.359
that right yet.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.920
Indeed.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.640
Jiang Yao's just a piece in your game.

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:05.879
What about me?

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.760
Am I the same?

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:21.039
In a month,
it's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.800
Yuze is home this year.
We must have a grand celebration.

00:12:25.319 --> 00:12:26.719
There's no need to go overboard.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.120
I'd be happy just if the whole family
could sit down

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:30.519
and enjoy a good meal together.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.239
Lian Xinruo!

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.519
Miss, you can't go in!

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.800
Let go!

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.559
Lian Xinruo, it's all my fault.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.838
I shouldn't have killed you.

00:12:38.839 --> 00:12:40.158
It was Wu Peirong's idea.

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:42.119
He said killing you
would get him the Lian family.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.999
I beg you!

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.719
Please!

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.999
Don't come after me at night!

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.400
What do you mean?

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.758
Xinruo didn't kill herself?

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:49.839
It was me...

00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:51.798
It was Wu Peirong! Go haunt him instead!

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:53.039
Leave me alone!

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.119
Xinya, what are you talking about?

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.959
I'm right here, aren't I?

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.480
Did you have another nightmare?

00:12:59.719 --> 00:13:02.639
Right. You're Du Youmeng.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.559
You're not Lian Xinruo.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.400
Lian Xinruo is dead.

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:08.439
Lian Xinruo is dead.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.560
You heard that, right, Mr. Pei?

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.800
Lian Xinruo is dead.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.520
You promised to help me
acquire the Lian family.

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:19.399
Does that mean I'm the new head now?

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.039
She's delirious from her illness.
She's talking nonsense.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.198
Butler, take her away.

00:13:24.199 --> 00:13:26.759
- Hurry! Get her out of here!
- I'm the head of the Lian family!

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.439
Take her away!

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.720
Let me go!

00:13:39.679 --> 00:13:40.719
Xinruo.

00:13:42.159 --> 00:13:43.439
Xinya's illness looks serious.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.320
We should pay her a visit later.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.720
You're right.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.799
Miss Xinya, the Pei family's Second Master
and Miss Xinruo have come to see you.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.240
