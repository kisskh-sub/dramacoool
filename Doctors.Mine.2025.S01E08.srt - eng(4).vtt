(Episode 8)

00:01:22.912 --> 00:01:23.744
Are you tired?

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.344
Do you want some water?

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.152
Fine, I'm still okay.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.976
Hey!! P'Knight, There are a lot of people.

00:01:44.272 --> 00:01:45.980
I was just joking.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.760
Did you really think I was going to feed you water?

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.736
Just go on ahead and hike up the mountain.

00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:53.976
Mild!

00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:57.200
Do you want some jelly?

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.040
Yeah, I'll have some.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.184
Hey, wait a minute! I just asked if you wanted my water.

00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:05.512
Why didn't you drink my water, Mild?

00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:07.112
Hey!!

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.440
Oh, Klah.

00:02:08.464 --> 00:02:09.936
What's going on?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.128
Don't bother them.

00:02:11.168 --> 00:02:12.424
The snack in your hand...

00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:14.760
it's probably not as interesting as
what those two are about to do.

00:02:14.784 --> 00:02:15.392
Let's go.

00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:16.688
I just wanted to share it with our friend.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.024
Let's go back to our place. Come on.

00:02:19.048 --> 00:02:19.896
What's wrong with him?

00:02:26.864 --> 00:02:28.860
Hey, doctor. How have you been?

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.504
I haven't seen you in a long time.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.952
Yeah, well... I'm okay.

00:02:34.248 --> 00:02:35.552
Whoa... what the hell?

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.624
What's up... is it only me
who's going to die from being apart?

00:02:39.672 --> 00:02:41.936
Well, I'm already strong.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.944
What are you doing, Per?

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.416
I'm just looking at someone who's stubborn.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.224
Your eyes are so swollen,
but you're saying you're strong.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.640
You must be crying every day.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.464
You love me so much, don't you?

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.344
Who says I love you?

00:02:59.344 --> 00:03:01.340
Even if you didn't tell me, I'd know.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.592
We're a couple now.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.904
And who says we're a couple.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.632
Hey, Doc! Doc!

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.856
Per, let me go!

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.288
But you have to give in first.

00:03:15.312 --> 00:03:17.032
Say that we're dating.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.928
Per, yeah. I give in.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.976
We're dating. We're a couple.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.512
Are you happy now?

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.896
You're so cute.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.368
Oh Per! That's enough!

00:03:34.608 --> 00:03:37.336
It's not enough. I miss you!

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.520
Oh Per. Why are you so infatuated with me?

00:03:41.552 --> 00:03:44.720
I feel like a goldfish is sucking on my head.

00:03:44.776 --> 00:03:48.544
You're so cute. I'll be your goldfish.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.064
Oh, now I'm a catfish. Your whiskers are poking my head.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.336
Ahhh, that's enough! Let me go! Ahhh!

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.136
Doc, wait for me. I have a lot of stuff.

00:04:00.704 --> 00:04:05.648
Sir, uhm... all the things that the kids brought over here...

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:12.216
What's up?

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.208
Hey...

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.176
Are you okay?

00:04:15.192 --> 00:04:16.424
I'm fine, bro.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.392
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

00:04:20.408 --> 00:04:21.624
Okay, Let's go.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.928
I'm very happy

00:04:33.968 --> 00:04:38.240
that we all got to come and
help organize this volunteer camp.

00:04:38.272 --> 00:04:42.320
This year, the National Park Office
has provided assistance to the university,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.872
which is how this project came to be once again.

00:04:44.888 --> 00:04:50.128
It's also an opportunity
for everyone to develop in many ways.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.864
I want everyone to use the knowledge they've learned

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:58.768
to be of the greatest benefit to the villagers here.

00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:00.224
Do your best, kids.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.896
Yeah!!!

00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:11.512
Alright everyone, now I'd like to invite the
village chief to say a few words to the kids.

00:05:11.552 --> 00:05:12.984
Hello, everyone.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.912
Hello!

00:05:13.928 --> 00:05:16.160
I'm the village chief here.

00:05:16.192 --> 00:05:19.080
I'm very happy that you've all come to help develop our village.

00:05:19.112 --> 00:05:21.144
If you need anything, just let me know.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.592
There's also another thing I want to warn you about.

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:27.424
We believe in ghosts and spirits in this village.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.856
Doctor...

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.736
Per, what's wrong with you?

00:05:32.312 --> 00:05:33.032
Per.

00:05:33.128 --> 00:05:34.008
I'm scared.

00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:38.792
Per!

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.600
Don't go out of your accommodation at night.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.448
There are dangerous wild animals here,
and the spirits of the forest and mountains too.

00:05:47.488 --> 00:05:49.824
Okay, kids, how about this.

00:05:49.856 --> 00:05:53.368
Everyone can go and get to work now.

00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:54.536
Is that okay?

00:05:54.568 --> 00:05:55.416
Yes.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.896
Okay, great. Thank you.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.048
Be careful, It's dangerous at night.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.816
I'm going to kill the ghost named Per
until he's never reborn.

00:06:15.512 --> 00:06:16.544
You're cruel.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.096
Ahhh, Let's get to work…

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.928
Go to work!

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:57.624
How are you?

00:06:57.648 --> 00:07:00.168
I'll check your symptoms now.

00:07:02.144 --> 00:07:03.224
Hello.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.440
Don't be worried.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.416
I'll prescribe some medicine for you.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.568
Please wait for your medicine in the back.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.568
Kan.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.856
Hey!! Mayo!

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.968
Mild, don't cry. It's me, it's me.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.432
What are you doing, P' Knight?

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.184
Who said I was playing around?

00:09:38.352 --> 00:09:40.080
Can't I just want to be with you?

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.824
We haven't talked all day today.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.720
Are you addicted to me?

00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:51.616
It's been a long time.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.760
So you're just going to stay here all day?

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:54.920
No need to go drinking.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.288
I don't mind.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:15.432
Mild!

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.976
The drinking party is starting!

00:10:23.792 --> 00:10:25.608
Then next time.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.960
I'll be waiting.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.864
Let's go! Cheers, everyone!

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:47.880
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

00:10:47.896 --> 00:10:48.544
Bottoms up?

00:10:48.568 --> 00:10:49.312
The last one to finish pay us all Korean BBQ.

00:10:49.312 --> 00:10:50.688
Hey, wait!

00:10:50.712 --> 00:10:51.872
Did I miss something?

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.648
How are you? Are you tired?

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.712
I'm okay.

00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:04.656
It's been fun.

00:11:04.688 --> 00:11:06.424
I haven't done anything like this in a long time.

00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:10.088
You're doing it so well.

00:11:10.576 --> 00:11:12.580
I wouldn't be able to build this.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:18.456
Aw..., so you've been watching me all the time, huh?

00:11:18.832 --> 00:11:20.830
What? It's you.

00:11:20.856 --> 00:11:22.830
Every time I turn around, you're always looking at me.

00:11:22.864 --> 00:11:27.712
Aw, because when you're treating a patient,
it's so charming.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.664
Of course it is.

00:11:30.688 --> 00:11:33.936
I was the star of the medical faculty, you know.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.392
Everyone says that.

00:11:36.928 --> 00:11:38.120
I'm annoyed.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.504
Yeah, that's normal. Everyone likes me, you know.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:50.424
Even that person who just served us water?

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.912
Oh, Mayo.

00:11:58.688 --> 00:12:00.184
He's my patient.

00:12:00.208 --> 00:12:01.592
I treated him once,

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.688
so he probably came to say thanks.

00:12:05.496 --> 00:12:09.952
Hmm, you're getting quite popular.

00:12:10.608 --> 00:12:13.048
I guess I'll have to assert my ownership.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.904
Hey Per, Per! Let go!

00:12:18.936 --> 00:12:21.512
Per! Oh, I'm so embarrassed in front of
the spirits of the forest and mountains.

00:12:21.536 --> 00:12:23.032
Why are you embarrassed, Doc?

00:12:23.048 --> 00:12:24.672
Aww, you might not be, but I am.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.368
Just one more time.

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.472
You're late. / The latecomers.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.528
They have to get it. Drink it neat.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.304
Go on.

00:12:34.328 --> 00:12:34.984
For the latecomers.

00:12:35.016 --> 00:12:36.856
Go on, my friend./ Sorry, guys, I'm late.

00:12:36.888 --> 00:12:39.192
You're late, so gonna get it.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.488
Drink it neat!

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.550
Let's go!

00:12:41.592 --> 00:12:43.550
C'mon, one glass each!

00:12:43.992 --> 00:12:44.968
Oh.

00:12:45.008 --> 00:12:49.552
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.536
Wait, you said you quit drinking!

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.960
I'll drink it for you.

00:12:58.992 --> 00:13:04.640
You're so cool!

00:13:04.792 --> 00:13:08.984
Per, if you're gonna act like a hero
like those two, Just don't.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.416
I'll drink it myself.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.960
Mmm, this's it.

00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:13.496
It has to be like this!

00:13:14.392 --> 00:13:16.464
You're so cute.

00:13:16.496 --> 00:13:18.584
Hey Per, I'm your brother.

00:13:18.608 --> 00:13:19.768
Too sweet!

00:13:19.808 --> 00:13:22.392
Who calls their boyfriend "brother"?

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.112
Just drink, bro. Don't talk so much.

00:13:27.128 --> 00:13:29.980
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.176
Of course, this person will finish it.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.000
I'm not drunk.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.240
If you're not drunk, lift your head up.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.752
Hey, are you not going to let me lean on you anymore?

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.304
No, I'm just going to move a little.

00:14:03.872 --> 00:14:05.152
Want more, doc?

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.192
You're trying to get me drunk?

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.824
And is that working?

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.744
Sorry. This isn't enough to get me drunk.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.888
But I'm drunk.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.944
If you're drunk, go to sleep.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.928
Hey!

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.520
You'll get drunk!

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.832
Don't you dare stop me.

00:14:28.856 --> 00:14:29.880
Give it to me.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.536
You never understand me.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:38.312
Hey!! A drinking circle like this needs some games.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.936
Klah, help me think of it.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.592
Woah, you're just tossing it to me.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.280
How about 'Never Have I Ever'?

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.496
Yeah, who wants to play?

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.232
I'm down.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:58.240
Kan, can you walk me to the restroom? It's dark.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.048
Don't go.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.472
Per, my friend is a woman. It's dangerous.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:16.264
I'm a man who's very drunk and very handsome.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.568
Doctor, if you leave me here,
aren't you afraid someone will snatch me away?

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.504
Just a moment.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:36.920
Just a moment.

00:15:57.816 --> 00:15:59.984
Are you really dating N'Per?

00:16:04.336 --> 00:16:06.340
Yeah, I am.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.264
Can you even date a guy?

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.592
It doesn't matter if I'm dating a guy or a girl.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.160
What matters is if I really like him.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.968
That's what's important.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.592
I love you.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.480
But I don't like you.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.256
I've already told you that.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.864
Don't do something you'll regret while you're drunk.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:20.608
I know you can't love me,

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:35.248
but I just want you to know that I love you very much.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.704
I've been waiting for you for a very long time.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.448
Six years, Kan. Six years.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.488
Why have you never looked at me at all?

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.392
Natcha, I've already told you that I don't like you.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.736
If you still want to be my friend,

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.440
don't do this.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.216
I'm sorry,

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.504
I'm really sorry.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.992
Please take care of her for me.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.416
I'm sorry.

00:19:24.296 --> 00:19:25.420
Natcha.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:32.664
What have I done?

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.936
I shouldn't have done it. I don't want to lose him.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.424
It's okay. It's okay.

00:19:46.448 --> 00:19:49.928
Even if Kanjan doesn't love you, I love you.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.208
I don't want to love him as a friend.

00:19:55.584 --> 00:19:57.580
What's wrong with me?

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.640
I met him first.

00:20:06.528 --> 00:20:08.160
Love is like this.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.208
But you're good. You're the best, believe me.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.480
Kan loves you as a friend.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.936
Give yourself time to move on.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.952
Do I really have to move on?

00:21:21.992 --> 00:21:23.160
I'm sorry.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.232
Per.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:47.464
What're you doing sitting here all by yourself.

00:21:47.496 --> 00:21:48.696
Did the drinking party end?

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.360
Not yet.

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:53.140
I thought you weren't gonna be here.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.376
Do you think I'm weak, incompetent,
and can't protect myself?

00:21:59.752 --> 00:22:01.750
Well, you gave in to her.

00:22:02.744 --> 00:22:04.740
I thought you'd be comforting her until morning.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.624
She's my friend.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.928
But I'm your husband.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:17.000
Hey, Per, I've been gone for a while.
And you're still not done drinking?

00:22:21.992 --> 00:22:23.990
Up to you then.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.416
And is this your tent?

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.568
Hold on.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.456
What?

00:22:33.808 --> 00:22:35.256
You're going to sleep with me?

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:40.720
N'Per, I've walked all the way to your tent.

00:22:40.752 --> 00:22:42.720
I'm probably not here to hang out.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.336
Let's just sleep.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.464
Wait for me, Doc!

00:22:54.944 --> 00:22:56.780
Doc!

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.200
What's wrong with you?

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.968
Do you know how long it's been
since we last saw each other?

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.000
Three weeks.

00:23:07.776 --> 00:23:10.512
And do you know how much I've missed you?

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.096
How would I know, Per?

00:23:15.184 --> 00:23:18.290
Then do you know we're boyfriends now?

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.504
Yeah, that I know, that you and I...

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.640
Per, Per, I can't breathe.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.896
But you started it.

00:23:36.936 --> 00:23:38.496
How did I start it?

00:23:38.536 --> 00:23:39.968
You came to sleep with me.

00:23:40.024 --> 00:23:42.352
Did you think I could hold back?

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.408
I just didn't want to sleep in the resthouse.

00:23:47.064 --> 00:23:49.060
I wanted to be closer to nature,

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.776
what's wrong with that?

00:23:51.824 --> 00:23:54.144
So, doctor, take it off.

00:23:54.152 --> 00:23:55.488
Why?

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.904
Because my darling wants to feel nature.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.432
How about we sleep naked tonight?

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.280
Ahhhh!

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.056
Doc! That hurts!

00:24:09.104 --> 00:24:10.580
Good, it should hurt.

00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:12.640
You should think like a normal person.

00:24:12.672 --> 00:24:14.264
We'd freeze to death.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.848
That's why we should sleep naked
and exercise to get rid of the cold.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:21.720
I'm tired.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.136
I'm going to sleep.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.824
Doctor...

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:46.848
Hmm?

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.864
I'm glad we're here together now.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.448
Yeah, I'm glad too.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.104
I love you, Doc.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.664
I love you too, Per.

00:25:26.376 --> 00:25:30.256
P' Pat, are you not mad at me anymore?

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.688
Why did you let me drop you off?

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.016
What's the big deal?

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.240
We're a couple.

00:25:37.816 --> 00:25:39.616
Can't you do just this one thing for me?

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.720
Let me ask you something.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.904
All the time we've been together,

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.680
have you ever really loved me?

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:54.392
Or did you just date me
because you wanted a personal servant?

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.560
Because you wanted information on Mild?

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.760
What am I to you?

00:26:00.224 --> 00:26:03.280
Tum, don't you dare use that tone with me.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.232
And did I ever ask you to date me first?

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.792
You can't even get anything I ask you to do.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.224
Seriously, what's the point of us even though
we're still together?

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.320
I should've listened to Klah from the start.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.936
You never truly loved me.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.000
Tonklah Tonklah Tonklah!

00:26:28.024 --> 00:26:29.728
Mild Mild Mild!!

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.730
Your life is all about your friends.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.656
If you love your friend so much,
why don't you just go live with them?

00:26:34.696 --> 00:26:37.320
Sure, I'll go.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.192
If you walk out, we're over.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.680
Fine, that's what I want anyway.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.656
Fine! Just go!

00:26:51.656 --> 00:26:52.912
Go wherever you want.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.184
I can find someone a million times better than you.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.736
What's up?

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.048
Hey Klah, let's have a drink together first.

00:27:26.856 --> 00:27:27.952
What's wrong?

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.824
I just broke up with P' Pat.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:38.688
I just realized everything you warned me about was true.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.592
She broke up with you?

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.336
No, I broke up with her.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.640
I don't know why I should be with someone
who doesn't love me.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.856
So, she told you?

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.224
I don't want to think about it anymore.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.832
Yeah, it's okay.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.232
Stay with me.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.200
It might be a little late,

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:47.048
but I just realized I can live without P' Pat.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:53.168
But if I don't have you, I'd be sad more than this.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.136
I'll be here for you,

00:29:03.584 --> 00:29:05.580
for as long as you need me.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:10.968
Hey P' Fern!

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.832
Are you okay?

00:30:22.552 --> 00:30:23.472
Are you alright,

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.672
are you hurt?

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.632
Fern, Are you okay?

00:30:30.632 --> 00:30:31.560
Mild.

00:30:31.592 --> 00:30:32.520
Are you okay?

00:30:32.528 --> 00:30:34.096
Does it hurt? Are you alright?

00:30:38.232 --> 00:30:39.176
What the hell are you doing?

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.624
P'Fern was about to fall,
so I went to help her. It's nothing.

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:49.984
It's okay.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.352
He went out to help you, and instead of thanking him...

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.672
Fern was startled, didn't you see?

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.240
P'Knight, it's okay.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.560
I'm okay.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.672
Let's go.

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:05.608
But Mild...

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.200
Please.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.352
I want you to treat my wound.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.168
Let's go.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.152
Does it hurt?

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.176
It's okay. Not much.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.264
Why did you go to help him, huh?

00:31:37.304 --> 00:31:40.744
P'Knight, someone was in danger.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.288
Besides, I'm a doctor.

00:31:43.336 --> 00:31:46.408
I have to help no matter who it is.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.320
When you date a doctor,
you should get used to this kind of thing.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.928
I'm so sorry.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.128
For making you worry.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.536
But P'Fern really isn't at fault here.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.432
Mild,

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:14.880
thank you for helping me.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:22.424
And I'm sorry if I ever said anything
or thought anything bad about you.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.688
That's all I wanted to say.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.736
P'Fern.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:32.840
I'm sorry, too. For everything.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.472
Let's go, Fern.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.552
I've cleared things up with P'Fern.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.296
Have you tried talking to P'Night properly?

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.760
I already cleared things up with her a long time ago.

00:32:52.784 --> 00:32:54.760
I told her that we're just friends with benefits.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.648
But what you said, did you really talk to her nicely.

00:33:00.688 --> 00:33:02.720
Or really listen to her feelings?

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.320
No matter what she says, I won't change my mind.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:14.168
P'Knight, do you know how to carry
the feeling of loving someone all by yourself?

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.640
The pain is endless.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.864
So I went to listen to them, what's next?

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.536
Just let them express all their feelings.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.008
After this, what happens?

00:33:29.016 --> 00:33:31.010
They've already tried their best.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:41.976
A clear rejection and a good farewell are important.

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:46.752
And you're okay with that?

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.032
At least you two won't have any lingering feelings.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.736
Okay, I'll find a chance to go talk to them.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.112
That's great.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.272
I think it's just a fever from the changing weather.

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:18.848
Nothing to be too worried about.

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:21.200
You can pick up your medicine at the back later.

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.072
Welcome.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.240
P'Kan.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.848
Oh, Mayo. What's up?

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:39.848
I just saw that you were so busy
that we didn't get to talk much.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.136
Yeah, that's right.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:44.592
How are you? The results from the last check-up...

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.624
Uh... well...

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:51.424
Is the person who did this to you still bothering you?

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:53.792
He... so...

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:55.216
Yo.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.200
P'Guy.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.504
I think we should all calm down.

00:35:02.536 --> 00:35:04.880
Um... maybe we should talk things through slowly?

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.216
Who the hell are you?

00:35:08.416 --> 00:35:09.760
I'm senior.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.304
I don't think you should be using that word with me.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.144
Don't be nosy.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.304
Hey! Let him go!

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.248
He doesn't want to go with you.
I don't think you have the right to do this!

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.200
Why are you butting in?

00:35:26.848 --> 00:35:28.850
Because I'm the one taking care of him.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.192
Because of your bad actions.

00:35:31.208 --> 00:35:32.784
And he's my new boyfriend.

00:35:33.272 --> 00:35:34.744
Please stop bothering me.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.352
His new guy is better. Can't you accept that?

00:35:44.648 --> 00:35:45.304
Hey!

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.552
Whoa!! What's going on?

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:48.936
Hey Per!

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.560
He's mine, don't you dare interfere.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.064
Got it?

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:57.672
Yes.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.440
Mayo, are you hurt? Are you okay?

00:36:04.464 --> 00:36:05.330
I'm fine.

00:36:05.352 --> 00:36:06.376
Let me take a look.

00:36:06.416 --> 00:36:08.808
Come sit down.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.264
That's enough.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.992
Let him do it himself.

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.824
Not yet. Just a little bit more and it will be done.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.728
I'll go get you some medicine.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.760
But... Doctor.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.744
Doctor...

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.376
If it hurts, tell me.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:02.840
Yes.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:17.064
And don't use your arm for a while. Okay?

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.064
Yes. Thank you, P'Kan.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:20.672
Umm.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.440
Per, Per, wait for me.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.856
Per, what's wrong?

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:37.496
Are you mad at me?

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.752
You don't pay attention to me.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.728
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:45.848
Let's make up, okay?

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:54.328
Per, I'm embarrassed.

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.616
Per,

00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:58.648
Per, let me go.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.264
Are P' Kan and P' Per...

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:05.936
Husband and wife.

00:38:07.872 --> 00:38:09.128
Uh, Mayo, what I mean is...

00:38:09.176 --> 00:38:10.176
It's okay.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:14.656
What is meant to be ours will always be ours.

00:38:22.104 --> 00:38:23.552
What did he say?

00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:38.880
Per, let me tell you this right now.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:45.048
Besides you, I really don't want anyone else.

00:38:47.776 --> 00:38:50.792
I've given my heart to you only.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:56.672
Per, Per, Per!

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:00.408
Per, let me go!

00:39:37.584 --> 00:39:39.550
I'm so stupid, just like Klah said.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.456
I was stuck in a toxic relationship
and didn't want to leave.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:50.208
People who are stuck in a toxic relationship
don't even realize it.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:57.776
So I looked stupid, right? I looked stupid?

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.200
No, You're the most normal you've ever been right now.

00:40:02.232 --> 00:40:04.984
Ohh, so before this, I did look stupid then.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.552
Huh? You said it yourself.

00:40:06.576 --> 00:40:07.664
Hey, you ass!

00:40:07.704 --> 00:40:10.960
Alright, alright, everyone, please listen up.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.600
My younger brother has something he wants to say to someone.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.528
Woah, bro, that's so sweet.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.016
The heroine let's stand right in front.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.200
Who's the heroine?

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:30.336
It might not sound good, but I want you to listen.

00:40:41.688 --> 00:40:46.352
Baby baby babe, I thought it was just a fairy tale.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:53.832
Baby baby babe, not a dream, you're right in front of me

00:40:53.864 --> 00:41:02.512
I don't know how to thank you enough, For us having each other today.

00:41:02.536 --> 00:41:08.000
Can I call you "My Babe"?
Because my whole heart I give to you.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:13.712
Can I call you "My Babe"?
Because my whole heart I dedicate to you.

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:19.344
Whenever I turn, I see you. Because you are the answer.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:27.360
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else, except for you.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.840
P'Knight, are you going to propose to my friend?

00:41:33.864 --> 00:41:35.976
Yeah, it's true. We're giving him to you!

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:39.312
Something like this, I need Mild to hear it alone.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.696
Can you come with me for a while?

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.416
I have something I want to show you.

00:41:58.272 --> 00:41:59.136
Where are you going?

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.400
Hey, Mild!

00:42:00.448 --> 00:42:01.384
Just for a moment.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.736
Hey, hey, guys...

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.552
Cheers!

00:42:12.576 --> 00:42:13.992
Bottoms up, guys.

00:42:28.432 --> 00:42:29.240
Mild,

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.896
I know I'm not a good person.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:40.688
I have a lot of flaws and I've done a lot of stupid things.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:48.096
But I want you to know that I really love you.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.392
Umm, I knows.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:00.208
There's one question I've wanted to ask you for a long time.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:17.816
Will you be my boyfriend?

00:43:26.176 --> 00:43:29.504
Can you give me a chance? Be my boyfriend, okay?

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.928
Um.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.432
Really?

00:44:10.456 --> 00:44:11.224
Yes.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.256
Thank you. Thank you so much. I love you.

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:19.112
I can't breathe P'Knight.

00:44:19.144 --> 00:44:20.328
Umm. I know.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.424
I can't breathe P'Knight.

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:26.520
I'm so happy.

00:44:28.344 --> 00:44:30.340
I didn't think I'd have a day like this.

00:44:59.072 --> 00:45:00.840
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:05.632
I'm not uncomfortable at all.

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:11.952
You've shown me how much you love me.

00:45:44.088 --> 00:45:47.848
You can't stop smiling. What makes you so happy?

00:45:49.152 --> 00:45:51.150
I'm really happy.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.608
Do you know how long I've been secretly looking at you?

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.200
Since you started dating P'Ploy?

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.976
Yeah, that's really when it was.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.048
But Mild, do you know?

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:19.960
By the time I found out that Mud liked Ploy,
I was already with her.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:27.528
When I found out, I tried to stop contacting Ploy,
tried to distance myself from her.

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.968
I don't know what other people might think.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:41.488
But Mud, he's my only close friend.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.648
But this isn't your fault.

00:46:46.696 --> 00:46:48.280
Don't think you're to blame.

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:50.768
Hmm.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.464
Mild,

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:08.032
I have to admit, I had feelings for you
while I was dating Ploy.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:12.856
Stop feeling guilty about it.

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.816
It was a long time ago.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:21.312
I know.

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:28.528
That's why when I saw you again in university.

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:33.232
I sometimes thought maybe this was destiny
giving me a second chance.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.584
The spider walked clumsily.
When it was two o'clock, it clutched, clutched.

00:47:41.624 --> 00:47:44.696
The spider walked clumsily.
When it was two o'clock, it clutched, clutched.

00:47:47.984 --> 00:47:49.704
Don't you see he's uncomfortable?

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:59.712
P'Knight, do you know that
I've had a crush on you since the first day we met?

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:01.984
Really?

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:07.920
How can I do? You're so cool.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.824
Mild,

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:31.720
To be honest.

00:50:38.192 --> 00:50:40.190
I want you to be mine.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:54.320
I'm sorry.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.744
Did I make you feel bad?

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:13.072
Stop apologizing.

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.592
It's just like what you said that night.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.784
Start over with me.
