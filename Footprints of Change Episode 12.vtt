[Episode 12]

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:47.440
Minister Wen, please.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.280
Thanks.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.060
She's listening to that music again.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.400
You know her husband well?

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.640
We were just high school classmates.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.539
You could say that.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.280
He's the only one in the ROC government

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.920
that I could call a friend.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.310
Minister Wenï¼Œ

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.590
he's a good man.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.520
Is that so?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.750
I just came from her place.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.009
She said her husband

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.190
liked Soviet literature.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.190
I was wondering

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.380
among ROC government officials,

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.210
are there many who like Soviet literature?

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.400
Very few.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.750
Let me tell you something.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.400
Don't take this the wrong way,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.200
Minister Wen.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.400
When I first met you,

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.320
I often felt confused.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.030
You two don't look alike,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.810
but I always felt that

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.470
the two of you

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.270
had something in common.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.910
I don't know why.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.150
Why's that?

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.430
It's the way you act,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.579
and your character, things like that.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.520
I can't explain it clearly.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.910
Let me share a little story with you.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.750
They say the Communists value frugality,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.760
while the KMT is all corrupt, right?

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.120
But once,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.560
Zhaoyuan and I went for Japanese cuisine.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.120
When he entered the room

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.000
and took off his shoes,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.150
I saw this huge patch on his sock.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.120
I laughed so hard at him.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.110
Later I said,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.910
I'll just give you a stack of socks.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.710
And he told me,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.030
Zihe, don't mention this to anyone.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.840
It's so embarrassing.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.590
I wouldn't gossip about it.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.910
Anyway, what I'm trying to say

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.710
is that

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.910
he doesn't really seem like an official.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.970
He's just very genuine.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.740
That's why I'm willing to be close to him.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.250
An ROC government official

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.770
wears a patched sock.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.920
By the way,

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.150
during that meeting,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.560
about Comrade Yang Xue'an's attitude,

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.890
was everyone's reaction quite intense?

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.329
Well...

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.470
Mr. Fu,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.730
I hope

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.810
you can use your own approach

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.110
from your perspective

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.740
to explain it to everyone.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.000
Can you do that?

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.900
Don't worry, Minister Wen.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.310
Good.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.400
[Half a month later]

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.590
Fresh vegetables.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.010
Zhaoyuan,

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.070
I've moved out of the old house

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.260
into a garret

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.990
like where you lived as a child.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.610
Tell me,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.710
can I wait for you to return here?

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.480
Miss Yi.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.950
Comrade Su.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.710
Can you get used to living here?

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.770
Didn't Mr. Fu arrange accommodation for you?

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:42.200
He did,

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.630
but I didn't go there.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.830
Comrade Su,

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.159
how did you know I live here?

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.270
Our neighborhood committee

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.510
notified Comrade Su.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.390
There's a newcomer in our neighborhood.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.790
We always need to investigate thoroughly.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.830
The Zhang family's Nanny is your neighbor.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.430
Miss Yi used to work with us.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.680
She's currently awaiting rearrangement,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.410
and temporarily staying here.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.720
Miss Yi,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.160
during your stay in Shanghai,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.290
you can ask her for help with anything.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.630
Although you don't work with us any more,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.290
as long as you're in Shanghai,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.310
we will take responsibility for you.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.110
I understand.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.410
If there's nothing else,

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.740
I'll head upstairs now.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.890
Don't leave yet.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.600
I have more words to say.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.800
Comrade Su,

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.030
you can rest assured.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.240
The residents in our neighborhood

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.240
have a very high level of vigilance.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.480
Just last year,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.390
we even caught a Kuomintang spy.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.310
We even received an award for it.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.430
Miss Yi,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.270
while you're living here,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.530
we will look after you.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.750
Your husband was in the Kuomintang, right?

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.190
I heard he went to Taiwan.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.570
Why didn't you go with him?

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.190
What are you doing here?

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.390
He went to Taiwan?

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.610
I didn't even know he went to Taiwan.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.740
How do you know that?

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.170
Su, look at this.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.600
She hasn't even properly moved in yet,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.120
and she's already so hot-tempered.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.370
How am I supposed to

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.300
look after you as your supervisor?

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.190
I remember you told me, Su,

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.480
about someone called Mr. Fu.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.780
It's said he's a boss.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.160
He must be wealthy.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.330
Why aren't you living with him?

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.600
With your looks,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.430
let me tell you,

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.690
those big bosses would surely fancy you.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.790
Zhang's Nanny,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.090
we shouldn't gossip about such matters.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.890
I'll go upstairs first.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.390
Miss Yi,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.650
you should leave Shanghai.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.760
I'm not leaving.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.360
Who is it?

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.920
Are you Mrs. Zhou?

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.600
Mr. Fu recommended us to come here.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.480
Please come in.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.800
Mr. Fu said

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.260
that your clothes are very fashionable

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
and insisted we come and take a look.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.370
These are all samples.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.470
Feel free to look around.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.680
And these too.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.210
This one looks nice.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.170
Yes, it would look especially good on you.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.810
It suits you perfectly.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.480
Mrs. Zhou,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.480
did you make all these yourself?

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.159
Yes, I did.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.040
They look fantastic.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.920
And the fabric is excellent too.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.070
I have some

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.800
fashion magazines from Paris and New York.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.860
You can take a look.

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:53.510
If you like any of the styles,

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.770
I can make them for you.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.870
My sister-in-law

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.800
bought this exact one in Paris.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.190
Mrs. Zhou, can you really make it?

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.370
Of course I can.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.950
Mrs. Zhou,

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.380
are you sure?

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.250
How about this?

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.070
Leave your fabric here,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.870
and when I finish,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.360
you can take it if you're satisfied.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.360
If you're not satisfied,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.890
I'll pay you for the fabric.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.560
If you're happy with everything,

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.290
please give the money to Mr. Fu.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.040
He's always helping me out,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.600
and I'd like to thank him.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.940
You want this, right?

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.419
The Zhang family's Nanny.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.000
Miss Yi, you're home.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.120
You have visitors.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.770
Two of my classmates are here.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.270
I've already spoken to Uncle Shui.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.080
Hello.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.520
What do you use this sewing machine for?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.720
I do some sewing and mending sometimes.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.790
I must say the clothes are so well made.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.580
The design, the choice of fabric,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.600
the style.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.480
Just imagine our daughter

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.080
wearing clothes made by you.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.740
How beautiful she would look!

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.480
If she wore a little princess dress,

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.240
just thinking about it

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.360
makes me so happy.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.520
What do you think?

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.510
Just imagine

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.360
that innocent little girl

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.910
wearing such a beautiful dress.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:22.840
How lovely that would be!

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.960
When I have time,

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.830
I'll make one for you.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.510
Thank you so much.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.750
But let me make it clear.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.630
Making clothes is one thing,

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.950
but that's separate from

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.590
our responsibility for you.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.180
We must look after you every day you're here.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.150
When I finish,

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.280
I'll bring it to you.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.600
Great, thank you.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.440
Okay, I'll let you get back to your thing.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.480
I'll be going now.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.670
It's so dark in here.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.600
And my eyesight isn't good either.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.390
Keep looking.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.370
I think this one looks quite nice.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.610
It has a great appearance.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.960
I can make this too.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.630
Really?

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.530
Is that true?

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.240
Great!

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.840
Then I'll take this one.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.550
Okay.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.030
Yang.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:15.870
Director.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.660
You should be off work now.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:18.870
Director,

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:19.550
I'll just

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.120
finish this bit of work before going home.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.670
Be careful

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.670
not to wear yourself out.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:27.270
Yes.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.480
Now

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.670
the public-private partnership and

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.240
capitalist transformation just started.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.200
Everything is difficult at the start.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.910
I promise

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:33.940
with the cases assigned to me,

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.670
I definitely won't make any mistakes.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.480
Good.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.080
How is your mother doing?

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.910
If necessary,

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.590
I've spoken with Minister Wen,

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.320
and he offered

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.030
to buy you a train ticket

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.230
and approve leave for you to go home.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.840
Thank you and minister.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.390
I'd

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:53.070
better not waste more time.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:53.800
I've decided

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.230
to finish all this work

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.080
and then go home right away.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.760
Good. Go home early then.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.230
- Donâ€™t worry. - Iâ€™m leaving.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:10:59.830
Take care.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.200
Okay.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.200
Who is it?

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.480
Ms. Yi Yi,

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.750
Minister Wen is here on behalf of

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.480
the organization to visit you.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.290
Coming!

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.210
Careful, mind your head.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:58.260
Okay.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.150
Can you stop drinking this nonsense?

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.570
How can this fill your stomach?

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.520
I drink it too.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.510
Minister,

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:26.850
you're different.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.230
You drink it to stay alert

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.490
when working at night.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.000
Zhou, there's a fruit vendor

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.630
at the alley entrance.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.080
Go buy some apples.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.070
Okay.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.630
This is from the leader for you.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.260
It's a compilation of national documents

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.320
on bourgeois reformation policies.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.080
Please study it carefully.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.670
Take it.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.630
Minister, I'm going now.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:01.450
Go ahead.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.840
I'm fine.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.480
I own no house,

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.310
no land,

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:22.830
no treasures,

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.530
yet I'm still labeled bourgeois.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.300
We let you read these documents

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.500
so you can understand

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.080
the Party and government policies.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.890
No one is trying to label you.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.200
You're being too sensitive.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.260
I'm not sensitive.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:42.790
I'm used to it.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.750
My room is a bit small.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.580
Please, have a seat here.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:03.500
No need.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.200
I'll stand for a moment.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.150
Would you like to try some coffee?

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.780
Sure.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:26.940
Good, thank you.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.840
It's good.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:43.840
Now that you leave here,

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.440
do you still listen to music?

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.150
Of course not.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.120
These walls are thin.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.550
If I cough,

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.210
the whole hallway can hear it.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.800
I quite enjoy listening to Pingtan now.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.150
I wonder if you like it too?

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.150
I do like it,

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.360
very much.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:06.810
But

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:07.890
I'm from the north,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.750
so I don't understand it well.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.010
I'll learn gradually.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.810
It gets very hot here in summer.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.000
Why

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.390
did you choose to live here?

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.510
I had no choice.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.200
My savings

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.390
only allow me to live here.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.640
Actually, compared to garden villas,

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.480
I find these garret rooms more grounding.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.240
It's like

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.620
I've already hit rock bottom,

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.680
so I can't fall any further.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.010
Don't be so pessimistic.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.550
The organization

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.330
is working to solve your employment issue.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.270
I'm not pessimistic.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.070
I truly think these rooms are quite nice.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.320
Great writers,

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:01.630
great artists,

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.250
and many revolutionaries have lived here.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.360
An elder once told me,

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.400
those who have lived in these rooms

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.130
and managed to move beyond them

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.080
are the true Shanghainese.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.940
You seem to

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.660
care a lot about being Shanghainese.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.550
No,

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.200
what I care about is one's identity.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.820
Actually, I'm a bit vain too.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.960
The great writer Lu Xun

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.920
wrote about garret rooms.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.640
That's right.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.380
The Qiejieting Essays.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.790
I believe your current situation

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:45.960
is only temporary.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.120
The organization

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.480
will definitely find

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.740
suitable work for you.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.030
We won't waste talent.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.920
You need to trust us.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.940
I trust you, Minister Wen.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.790
What I say

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.280
doesn't represent just myself.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.210
I represent the organization.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.000
But the organization is abstract.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.640
Common people like us

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.310
only see individuals.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:15.650
Minister,

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:16.780
the apples are here.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:17.880
Good.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.160
Zhou,

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.829
please have a good talk with Ms. Yi,

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.859
especially the policies

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:25.660
about educated intellectuals.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.030
I have a meeting.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:29.960
I need to go now.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.120
Minister Wen,

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.230
let me walk you out.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.560
Please be careful.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:59.790
â™ª The moon sinks low â™ª

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.750
â™ª The crows cry in the frosty sky â™ª

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:06.850
Beyond Suzhouâ€™s walls,

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.710
stands the Cold Mountain shrine.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.090
At midnight, temple bells drift softly

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.280
to my boat in time.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.540
It seems you were being modest earlier.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.200
You do understand, don't you?

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.950
I can handle simple ones,

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.430
but nothing too complex.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:26.660
Ms. Yi,

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.420
living here is different

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.550
from your previous environment.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.870
You must keep good relations

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.070
with your neighbors.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.160
Have you met the neighborhood committee?

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.210
Are they treating you well?

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:44.210
Yes, I have.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.440
They've all been very nice to me.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.240
Don't worry.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.920
That's good.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.490
I need to go to a meeting now.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:53.830
You stay.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:54.720
Goodbye.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.400
Goodbye.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:15.810
What are you doing?

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.370
I didn't mean to.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.400
I thought it was a novel.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.470
You read my diary without permission.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:26.130
Yes.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.030
I did read it.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.050
I meant to.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.010
I never thought your thinking

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.940
would be so negative and backward.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.710
My diary is written for myself,

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.140
not for others to read.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.580
But these are your thoughts!

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.260
Reactionary thoughts are also reactionary.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.310
Say something.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.950
What do you want me to say?

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.330
Let me tell you.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.750
I won't report you.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.080
But you need to confess.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.570
You must turn yourself in.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:09.750
Go.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.200
You go.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:18.920
I knew it.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:20.890
Someone like you

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.880
will never make any progress.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.770
[Shanghai People's Government]

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.030
Come in.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:36.550
Minister,

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.480
Director,

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.960
you wanted to see me?

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.440
Comrade Yang,

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.920
this train leaves in three hours.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.940
Pack your things quickly

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:45.840
and go home.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.160
Your work

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.240
has already been assigned to others.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:52.960
Minister,

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.030
there is lots of work lately.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.030
I'll leave after I finish.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.090
Work is important,

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.550
but your mother needs you more right now.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.290
Go back.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.000
I've already spoken with Director Fang.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.200
I want to finish my work before leaving.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.330
Once somethings happen, it's too late

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.260
to make up for it in a lifetime.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.440
Go home.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.270
Yang,

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.200
Minister Wen is right about this.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.840
You should go home first.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.030
Yang is really

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.430
a selfless and promising talent.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.240
Wenpu,

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.200
why do I feel

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.940
he's just like you when you were young?

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.380
Like me when I was young?

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.780
I've forgotten what I was like when I was young.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.580
Just like him.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:49.640
Ms. Yi,

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.090
what's the matter?

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.200
Director Wen,

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.370
Director Fang,

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.480
this is my personal diary.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.410
It's about daily life

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.770
and personal thoughts.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.320
Comrade Zhou Yunqing found my diary.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.830
She thinks I have reactionary thoughts.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.490
She wants me to turn myself in.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.070
So here is my diary

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.350
and I ask you to review it.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.920
Ms. Yi,

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.140
we will definitely read your diary.

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:28.180
You can go back first.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.010
We'll give you an answer later.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.160
No.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.410
I'm afraid once I leave this room,

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.050
I'll become someone everyone condemns.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.160
I'm scared.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.810
I want both leaders to read it now

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.240
and give me an answer right away.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:47.350
Ms. Yi.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.030
All right.

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.880
Please sit here and rest.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.530
We'll give you an answer after we finish.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.420
Please sit down.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.480
Zhou, Zhou.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.750
Mr. Yang.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:28.550
What's wrong?

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.190
I just peeked at Yi Yi's diary.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.480
Diary?

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.880
Tell me more.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.740
What did it say?

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.180
Comrade Zhou,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:43.800
let me ask you.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160
What kind of work

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.550
are we doing now?

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.090
Bourgeois reformation.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:49.880
As for Yi Yi,

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.160
as a typical petty bourgeois intellectual,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.010
her issues are not trivial.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.710
You must report truthfully.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.890
I'm going back to the office.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.090
We can talk on the way.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:23:59.690
Let's go.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.680
Let's go.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.720
We must report Yi Yi's issue

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.030
to Director Fang right away.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.110
Mr. Yang, it's not that serious.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.920
I'll go with you.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.510
Well.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.480
Minister, Director.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.190
Minister.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.590
Director.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.070
Zhou,

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.870
Yi Yi has brought the diary.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.520
See if this is the one.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.330
She brought it here?

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.350
Yes.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:21.810
Everything's here.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:22.540
Are you sure?

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.590
Yes, I'm sure.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.640
She must have thought you read her diary

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.680
and would report to the organization,

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.410
so she confessed immediately.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.930
This person is quite calculating.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.260
If she were that calculating,

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.480
she could have simply not shown the diary.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.270
After all, Zhou has no proof,

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.000
right?

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.480
Yang,

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.240
weren't you supposed to go home today?

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.400
Your train leaves in two hours.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:45.440
You should go.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.640
You don't need to worry about it anymore.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.240
Minister,

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.070
this is my job

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.110
and not finishing it would be negligence.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:53.000
I'll leave after I finish.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.700
Very good.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.590
You stay then.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:56.790
Fu Zihe

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:57.920
and Yi Yi's case

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.720
is under Yang's responsibility.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.250
Let's discuss it together.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.070
Minister Wen, I remember you have

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.590
a meeting with visitors from Beijing

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.230
this afternoon, right?

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.580
You should go ahead with that.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.240
I'll take care of things here.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.100
Take the diary.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:31.880
Ms. Yi,

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.280
please sit here.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.680
I have

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.440
a few questions for you.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.110
Don't be nervous,

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.440
but you must tell the truth.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.440
Tell the truth.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.440
Yes.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.200
I heard

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.740
your husband was retreating to Taiwan,

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.120
but you insisted on staying in Shanghai.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.790
Why?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.030
I'm not sure.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.880
I don't know.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.440
Let me ask you.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.630
Your diary says

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.400
living

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.510
like an ant

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.480
without dignity,

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:16.750
No dignity.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.530
What does this mean?

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.160
Is this how you feel about New China?

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.270
I have no complaints about

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.270
New China or the Communist Party.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.730
But I do have issues with certain leaders.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.240
I'm frustrated

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:31.880
about my situation.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.670
Issues with the leaders?

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.310
What issues can you have with leaders?

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.640
You used the word ant

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.110
to describe your current situation.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.030
Is this just ordinary frustration?

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:53.880
Ms. Yi Yi,

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:55.590
I hope you'll tell the truth

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.190
and cooperate with our work.

00:26:58.030 --> 00:26:59.400
I don't know what you want me to say.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.600
Please stand up to answer my questions.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.370
Director Fang,

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.830
this person is being very uncooperative.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:14.640
Alright.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.810
You can go home for now.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.570
Leave the diary here.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.070
We will investigate

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.010
everything thoroughly.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:35.960
Minister Wen.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.550
Minister Wen.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:39.270
Hello.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.480
What are you doing here?

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.760
How did the discussion go?

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.640
No, Minister Wen,

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.800
we've clarified Yi Yi's situation.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:46.980
She went home first.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.880
What?

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.240
Minister,

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.590
I'd like to report something to you.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:56.160
Sure, go ahead.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.750
Yi Yi's stepfather doesn't earn much.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.520
Her mother is in poor health.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.260
She has two younger brothers at home.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.280
They haven't even finished school.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.440
If she's sent home as a reactionary,

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.140
what will happen for the rest of her life?

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.270
You

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:20.030
still care about her,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:20.880
don't you?

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:26.570
Zhou,

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.680
all humans have family bonds,

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.720
friendship and love too.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.790
It's normal.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.460
You care about her.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.410
It shows you're kind-hearted.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.440
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.270
Thank you, Minister.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:42.430
Do you have a good relationship

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.490
with your brother?

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.390
No.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.260
Zhou,

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.740
we know your situation very well.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.310
Our department is quite important.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:52.680
The fact that you were allowed to join

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.770
shows that we trust you, right?

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.200
I thank the organization.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.190
Minister,

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.880
before liberation,

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.270
actually, we had a good relationship.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.830
He wasn't like an official at all,

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.110
more like a soldier,

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.350
and an intellectual.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.050
He's more than ten years older than me.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.710
My brother has always been

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:24.540
very caring toward me.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.210
Among the people your brother dealt with,

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.350
was there anyone you still remember well?

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.880
Minister,

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.720
he didn't really have any friends.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.400
Nobody ever came to our home.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.180
Actually,

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.950
there was someone...

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.940
Yi Yi was in Hong Kong at that time.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.510
He asked me to send a book to someone.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.990
The person's surname was Jian.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.160
I remember because it's a rare surname.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.070
My brother told me

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.200
that this book delivery

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.480
must not be mentioned to anyone,

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.930
not even to Yi Yi.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.290
So I didn't tell anyone.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.770
Jian?

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.830
Spelled as J-I-A-N?

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:03.990
Yes.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.630
How old was this person?

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:07.960
What did they look like?

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:12.350
Minister,

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.340
I really don't know anything else.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.760
Have I done something wrong?

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.110
No.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.420
That's all.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.290
Come in.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.680
Yi, are you okay?

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.930
Why are you here?

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.560
Come on, get in my car. Hurry.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.930
You'd better keep your distance from me.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.730
I don't want to drag you into this.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.820
Don't say that.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.310
We're friends, aren't we?

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.040
Besides, I've asked Minister Wen about it.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:49.750
Your situation

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.140
is nothing serious at all.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.250
Just subordinates making a fuss.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.480
Miss Yi.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.480
Um, Miss Yi.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:58.920
Let's talk later.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.420
Comrade Su, goodbye.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.440
Miss Yi,

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.550
Mr. Yang called

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.210
and asked me to pick you up.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:14.440
Also,

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.610
although you no longer work here,

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:18.190
your personnel file is still with us.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.520
You should attend political activities.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:24.540
What do you mean?

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:25.710
This afternoon,

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.440
the Party branch is having an activity.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.570
You should come too.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.520
Let the worker sisters help you.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.320
Help me?

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:33.980
Help with what?

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.480
How can they help?

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:36.480
Mr. Yang says

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.600
you still have many negative emotions.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.960
You should express them,

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.890
so everyone can give you guidance.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.280
Of course,

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.590
if you have any difficulties in life,

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.390
they'll help you solve them too.

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.640
Let's go,

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.800
right now.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.700
What's wrong with you?

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:02.180
We're leaving, ma'am.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.430
Are you feeling very uncomfortable?

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:11.690
It's nothing serious.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.600
How did you suddenly get sick?

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:24.430
Just my chronic stomach problem acting up.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.090
Comrade Su, you can go now.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.080
You live alone and now you're sick.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.110
You need someone to take care of you.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:33.400
Oh, right.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:35.970
Your mom and brother are in another city.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.230
Why don't you go home to recover?

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:40.480
I won't leave Shanghai.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.030
I'm not forcing you to leave.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:44.110
I mean well.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.480
I just thought your family

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.340
could take care of you for a while.

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.720
I'm really fine, Comrade Su.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.310
Please go.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:54.790
Fine, I'll leave then.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:57.120
The water's boiling. Have some hot water.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.590
Listen, with your stomach pain,

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:01.580
don't just keep sitting there.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.380
Go lie down on the bed for a while.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.720
Zhou,

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.330
sit down.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.130
Tell us your feeligs after reading this.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:39.890
Minister.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.070
I won't say anything more.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.270
I've already said enough at the door.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.240
Sit down first.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.200
I want you to talk about

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.740
how you felt after reading the diary.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.110
You can speak.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.040
Actually, from my personal perspective,

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.710
I can understand Yi Yi.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.670
She's a petty bourgeois intellectual.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:14.070
Her thinking is rather fragile.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.280
Sometimes

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.670
she has negative emotions.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.800
It's quite normal for her to complain.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:20.400
Comrade Zhou Yunqing,

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.330
you're too naive in your thinking.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.960
This is a serious matter of class stance.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.080
Don't be so vague.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.690
I already said I won't talk about it.

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:29.550
Why are you crying?

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.670
I'm not.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.150
No, I immediately

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:33.880
reported to you about Yi Yi's diary

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.480
as soon as I found out.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.960
This is work, not a game.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:36.830
Sit down.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.590
Minister,

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.190
Director,

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.510
regarding

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.110
Yi Yi's case,

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.110
I have my own opinion.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:53.790
I'd like to

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.880
say a few words.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.030
The new China has just been established.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.400
All kinds of criminals

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.220
are appearing in various forms.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:06.440
I believe

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:07.920
Yi Yi's diary...

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.510
Yang,

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.250
a diary, by definition,

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.220
is for recording personal events

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.070
and expressing private emotions.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.860
It's not meant to be read by others

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:17.660
and has no propaganda effect.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:20.380
I believe in your own diary,

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.430
you also record negative emotions.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.510
Should we also take that out

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.910
for everyone to discuss?

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.610
I've read Yi Yi's diary.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.630
It's not that bad.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.630
Minister Wen is right.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.840
Very reasonable.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.230
We shouldn't casually label people with

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:41.030
political issues

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.490
or counter-revolutionary charges, right?

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.780
I think

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.460
Yi Yi should just write a self-criticism for this matter,

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.570
and it won't go into her permanent record.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:53.100
That's settled then, okay?

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.010
If you have things to do, go ahead.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.670
Look.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.630
Those files of yours aren't processed yet.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:17.690
You go ahead first.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:28.710
What's wrong with you?

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.790
I've told you so many times.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:32.280
When you talk and work,

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.760
can't you use your brain?

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.230
Why can't you remember?

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.730
You're too childish

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.550
and too inexperienced.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:42.720
Um...

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.080
The new tea has arrived.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.210
Commissioner Yan got some for you.

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:47.510
It's in my office.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.440
Don't forget to take it after work.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.890
Did you hear me?

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:36.030
Zhaoyuan,

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.800
you know what?

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.020
Looking from this window,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.880
I can see our old home.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.490
All these years since you left,

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.760
I often wonder,

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.620
if I had stopped you then,

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.510
would I have avoided all this criticism?

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.070
Could we have lived

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:00.670
an ordinary life?

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.220
I deliver documents to Minister Wen.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:11.490
Who are you?

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:13.800
I'm Minister Wen's superior.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.730
Greetings, sir.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.800
Just put the documents on the desk.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.320
Okay.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.030
Liu.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.520
Minister Wen,

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:21.300
I gave the documents to your superior.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.050
My superior?

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:23.230
This gentleman here.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.670
Alright.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:24.360
Okay, I understand.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:24.810
You may go now.

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:25.250
Okay.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:29.150
What?

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.550
I can't be your superior?

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:31.830
Idiot.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Smartass.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.850
Get up. Don't sit in my chair.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.540
Go sit on that sofa over there.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.060
The minister's office is magnificent.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.960
Sit down.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.820
Why didn't you tell me before you came?

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.560
Why show up out of nowhere like this?

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.360
With you, I need to act suddenly.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.680
Otherwise you'd have time to prepare.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.570
What's the matter?

00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:59.030
What terrible tea is this?

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.110
It tastes awful.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.340
Next time I'll bring you some good tea.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.550
Be grateful to have any tea at all.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:04.630
Don't be so picky.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.100
It tastes just fine to me.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.440
You're here on a business trip?

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.440
Yes, on business.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.790
And I have something important

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.480
to report to Minister Wen.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:19.820
What important matter?

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:25.350
You'll have to treat me to dinner first.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:27.320
We can discuss it over the meal.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.960
Don't let me guess.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:31.760
I have to buy you dinner too?

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.470
Of course.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.920
Aren't I your

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.350
guest?

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.150
Hurry up.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.070
Hurry what? I'm still on duty.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.100
Wait for me at the restaurant downstairs.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.250
After I finish my work,

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.590
I'll come right over when I'm off.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:47.650
I'll treat you to dinner.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:48.360
My treat.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.440
Fine.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:52.440
Great news!

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:53.920
Good.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.680
Chief,

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.390
what kind of person is our Minister Wen?

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.530
I need to know a bit about him in advance.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:08.530
Don't worry.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.400
Minister Wen is charming and elegant,

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:12.670
handsome and talented.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:13.510
He's cultured when needed

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.880
and strong when required.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.740
You'll definitely be satisfied.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:17.600
Good.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.680
Minister Wen is here.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.640
Zhao.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.030
Wen.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:23.930
You have a guest.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.190
Let me introduce.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:27.870
Miss Huang Lingling.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:30.590
We can't call her Miss,

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:31.920
Comrade Huang Lingling.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.120
This is Minister Wen.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:34.710
Hello, Chief. Pleased to meet you.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.170
Hello. Please have a seat.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.480
Sit down.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.190
Good.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.190
Good.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.150
Look,

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.560
we've ordered all your favorites.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.630
You two are such important leaders.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.880
Why choose such a small restaurant?

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.720
If the hygiene isn't up to standard,

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.120
and you get sick,

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.520
that would be terrible!

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.540
Comrade Huang,

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.060
where do you usually eat?

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:08.920
Over on Nanjing West Road, there are

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.920
several nice Western restaurants.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.640
Next time I'll treat you to a meal there.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.120
Actually, we're

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.280
used to being frugal,

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.940
especially our Minister Wen.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.440
You see, we've been near death

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.030
so many times.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.320
We're really not used to

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.670
those foreign dishes.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.550
That's no problem.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:32.950
There are also Chinese restaurants there.

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:33.800
Good.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.530
Next time I'll find a chance

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.020
for us to get together.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.170
Is your watch accurate?

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:43.170
The watch? Very accurate.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.600
Extremely accurate.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.810
Miss Huang, you don't know.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:50.840
This watch was a gift from Minister Wen.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.880
This is the most

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.430
valuable and precious gift

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:56.190
I've ever received in my life.

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:58.320
I wear it day and night.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:59.690
It's what you call,

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.650
what's the phrase...

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:02.460
close as internal organs.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.300
This watch isn't that valuable.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.160
I bought it at a secondhand stall.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:09.440
The parts were all rusted then.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:10.760
I fixed it myself.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.780
I hope it's accurate.

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.240
Accurate. Very accurate.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.130
And what was that phrase you used earlier,

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.900
close as internal organs?

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.790
You meant 'close to the skin', right?

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:23.710
Right, it's close to my skin.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.850
Don't misuse phrases.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.630
Let's eat.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:30.670
Wrong words, talking nonsense.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.880
Huang,

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.850
I also ordered a plain noodle soup.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.100
Could you go check on it?

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.110
I'll go see.

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:43.360
Go hurry them up.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.710
How is it?

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.550
She's from south.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.030
Highly educated and artistic.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:56.600
What do you mean?

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.010
Introduce her to me?

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:01.230
Stop pretending.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.230
Stop being so picky.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:03.480
She's good enough.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:04.800
Do you even know her?

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.840
How did you even meet

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.960
a woman like that?

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.940
Alright, alright.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.020
Let's eat quickly,

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.210
and leave as soon as we're done.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:25.630
Like a dog biting Lv Dongbin,

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:27.280
you don't recognize good intentions.
