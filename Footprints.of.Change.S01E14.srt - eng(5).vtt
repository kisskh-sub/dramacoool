[Zhou Zhaoyuan]

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.630
Did he...

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
suffer at the end?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.720
Comrade Zhaoyuan

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.579
was secretly

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.760
and hastily executed

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.190
before the People's Liberation Army
entered the city.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.910
No one knows the details.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.590
I believe

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.660
he must have heard the gunfire

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.540

entering the city.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.910
Comrade Zhaoyuan

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.120
was prepared to sacrifice himself

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.260
from the day
he took the oath to join the Party.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.750
Any of us

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.030
would do the same.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.860
Since he was prepared to
sacrifice himself,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.510
why did he marry me?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.660
Why did he fall in love with me?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.760
Why did he leave me?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.360

The news about my brother

really came so suddenly.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.120
If you want to cry,

just let it out.

Crying is actually good for your health.

bottling up so much inside.

Actually, I'm just like you.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.560

What do you mean, "mentally prepared"?

possibly have a friend like him?

and still fools around with other women!

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:04.850

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.480
No.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:13.910
Then why?

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.840
You were the one who insisted on
staying here in the first place.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.910
Now that we've arranged

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.380
your accommodation and job,

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.380
you want to leave.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.970
Aren't you being...

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.080
If you have any issues,

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.240
you can just bring them up
with the organization.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.370
We'll definitely solve them if we can.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.920
I don't have a reason.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.650
I just want to go abroad.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.600
I have personal freedom, don't I?

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.910
What kind of talk is that?

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.770
If there's a problem, just say it.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.510
Well, Ms. Fang.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.600
You go to the hospital
to look after the Chief first.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.960
I'll talk to Ms. Yi.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.510
I remember you once told me

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.570
that you would never leave Shanghai.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:05.790
Including

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.150
in your letter to Mayor Chen.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.600
You said Shanghai was your spiritual home.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.000
Why do you suddenly want to leave now?

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.200
Could you please tell me your reasons?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:18.960
Of course.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.850
I've finally received news about Zhaoyuan.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.750
So I have no reason

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.630
to stay in this city anymore.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.250
Minister Wen.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.350
Thank you for what you did
regarding Zhaoyuan.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.970
Are you familiar with this area?

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.030
Of course I am.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.510
I used to live here.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.270
Shanghai, China's largest city,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.500
was ravaged by war,

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.650
yet most of its buildings and factories

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.480
have been preserved to the greatest extent possible.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.840
Do you know why?

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.870
It was underground Communists
like Zhaoyuan,

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.080
along with the progressive citizens of Shanghai,

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.540
who played a crucial role.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.900
Comrade Zhaoyuan sacrificed his life

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.560
for the cause of

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.240
lifting China out of poverty

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.540
so all Chinese people
could live better lives,

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.120
in peace and prosperity.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.390
That includes

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.030
you as well.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.200
I believe that was his wish too.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.120
Don't you...

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.200
want to stay and witness

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.240
your hometown

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.330
under the people's government

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.680
grow more prosperous

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.280
and more beautiful?

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.370
Let's sit for a while.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:40.120
Wait.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.720
Thank you.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.000
What are you looking at?

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:10.930
That dress is so beautiful.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.600
Whenever I see someone
wearing beautiful clothes,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.860
I can't help but stare.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.800
I understand.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.460
Your professional habit.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.750
By the way,

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.320
I think

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.930
when you're dealing with
the working class,

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.610
you could communicate with them more.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.600
I know

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.120
there are differences in aesthetic taste

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.120
between you and them.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.470
That's an objective fact.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.500
But I think you could guide them.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.100
-How can you be so sure I won't leave?
-Right?

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.040
I mean,

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.080
if you're going to stay.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.200
Where's the Chief?

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.340
He went for a medical examination.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.000
Why don't you wait for a while?

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.150
Okay. Okay.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.510
Hold on!

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.430
That's the Chief's sofa.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.740
There are chairs by the door.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.800
Go wait by the door.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.130
Alright.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.320
Wait!

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.250
Take your things with you.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:51.400
Ms. Fang.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.240
You're here.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:53.510
Where's the Chief?

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.120
He still has a few tests left.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.510
I came to get his scans for him.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.670
Sit. Sit on the sofa.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.510
Um... Chang!

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.750
Come on, come here.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.320
Sit.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.069
This is Minister Wen.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.400
So, you're Minister Wen.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:10.359
Hello.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.859
Please have a seat. Take the sofa.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.640
I know about you.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.440
You're a veteran revolutionary

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.790
and an expert in the revolutionary cause.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.680
It's such an honor to meet you.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.369
My name is Chang Huijuan.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.970
I'm your admirer.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.850
Nice to meet you.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.350
Ms. Fang, do you need any help?

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.240
No, no, no.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.000
You two carry on.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.590
I'll go keep Yan company.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.680
Well...

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.720
make some tea for Minister Wen.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.240
Okay.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440
Minister Wen enjoys tea.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.400
Where are you going?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.590
Just use Yan's tea.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.200
This girl is clever, skilled,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.730
and quite hardworking too.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.350
Minister.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:58.880
The tea I'm making for you is

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.480
Chief Yan's favorite.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.940
I always brew it
with 80-degree water for him.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.120
He really loves it.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.000
It's all been disinfected with high heat.
Don't worry.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.600
Thank you.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.840
Carry on with your work.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.360
The thread snapped again.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.220
You have to be gentler with it.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.200
Ms. Su.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:49.800
Ms. Yi.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.270
Why are you here?

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.680
Since our export workshop was established,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.590
this is the first time we're participating
in an international trade fair.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.070
The factory leadership takes it
very seriously

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.720
and assigned you the design task.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.550
Why aren't you working on your designs

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:02.880
instead of coming here?

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.270
This is the first draft of the designs.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.400
Do you have a moment?

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.000
I'd like your opinion.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.970
Although I'm the designer,

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.490
you're a master tailor.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.090
Your feedback is very important to me.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.920
Comrade Chang.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.440
How long have you been working?

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.960
Almost 10 years.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.800
You still look so young.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.610
My family was poor,

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.640
so I started working in my teens.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.160
That explains it.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.240
Then you're quite remarkable.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.070
No, no.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.720
I still have a lot to improve in my work

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.810
and need your guidance, Minister.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.480
For example,

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.680
I didn't let you sit on the sofa earlier.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.280
I feel really bad about that.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.310
I must thank the Communist Party.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.270
Otherwise, girls from poor families
like us

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.470
would have no future.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.570
Now, men and women are equal.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.120
As long as you work hard,

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.840
you'll certainly have a bright future.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.150
Minister, you speak straight to the heart.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.940
I'll certainly work hard.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.450
I've made all the changes.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.510
Ms. Yi,

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:46.790
I never thought

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.210
you'd listen to our workers' suggestions.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.330
We all just want our designs
to be excellent

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.860
and accepted by the market.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.750
Your input helps me,

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.150
so why wouldn't I listen?

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.140
I used to think
you were distant and arrogant,

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.520
looking down on others.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.790
But

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.180
ever since I learned
your husband was a revolutionary martyr,

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.040
my impression of you has changed.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.860
Since your husband was
a revolutionary martyr,

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.460
you must be a good person too.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.370
Is that what you think?

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.300
Yeah.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:17.960
Am I wrong?

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.360
Come in.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.270
Ms. Yi!

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.130
This is an invitation from our boss.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.680
Please make sure to attend.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.430
Alright, thank you.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.690
I'll take my leave now.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.920
I've seen that man before.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.270
He's Fu Zihe's subordinate, right?

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.820
What did he want with you?

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:47.010
Fu Zihe is a mutual friend
of my husband and mine.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.300
Let's leave it at that for now.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:52.500
Oh, right!

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.310
I need to inform you about something.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.350
There's a political activity
this Saturday.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.310
We'd like you to give a keynote speech.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.430
Please prepare for it.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.560
What kind of speech?

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.320
Your husband was a revolutionary martyr.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.550
We'd like you to talk about

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.440
Comrade Zhou Zhaoyuan's heroic deeds.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.580
You experienced this firsthand.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.700
So your speech will surely be moving.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.640
Inspire the workers so they willingly
embrace revolutionary education.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.240
That's an excellent way
to educate the masses!

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:25.940
Ms. Su.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:28.300
Please respect me.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.150
I don't want to publicly display

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:32.780
my personal grief.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.200
How is this disrespectful to you?

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.680
This is revolutionary work!

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.620
Besides, this was suggested
by Comrade Zhou Yunqing!

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.420
Zhou Yunqing?

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.280
Yeah.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.070
She said you and your husband
shared a deep bond.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.830
Between you two,

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.890
there must be many touching stories!

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:49.930
If you tell them,

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.770
it'll help the workers
understand the revolution

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:52.920
and the Party organization.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.050
This is a good thing!

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.510
I don't understand
why you're resisting it!

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.000
Everyone, please wait patiently
a bit longer.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.460
Hold on a little longer.
She'll be here soon!

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.390
Ms. Yi is really something else.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:20.960
Zhou,

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:22.510
you still need to work harder

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.200
on her ideological education.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.680
Even though her status has changed

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.270
and she's now a martyr's widow,

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.160
ideologically speaking,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.020
she's still far from where we are.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:30.880
Xiurong,

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.630
she's an intellectual,

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.440
so she has a strong personality.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.010
But she's a good person.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:37.840
I know that.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.930
Why did she come
wearing an old-fashioned qipao?

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.700
That's really inappropriate.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.070
Fellow workers,

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.070
today I'd like to talk to you about

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.000
the similarities and differences
between the qipao

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.680
we're about to put into production

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.030
and the traditional qipao.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.760
Don't talk about these things!

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.190
Tell them about my brother's heroic deeds!

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.200
Everyone, can you see the difference
between these two?

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:23.880
Ms. Yi,

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.530
we don't want to hear about qipao today.

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.830
We'd like to hear you talk about

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.030
Comrade Zhou Zhaoyuan's heroic deeds!

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:30.750
Yes!

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:32.680
-Right.
-Right.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:34.240
I want to tell you

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.790
that this qipao I'm wearing

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.210
was custom-made by my husband

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.540
as a gift for our 4th wedding anniversary.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.730
But he never saw me wearing it.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:02.930
Ms. Fang.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.300
Wait. Please stay.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:07.250
You take care of the Chief.
I'll head back first.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.870
Minister Wen.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.460
Minister Wen?

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:17.350
Minister.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.640
This is the loquat syrup I made.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.700
It soothes the lungs and eases coughing.
Please try it.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:23.830
Thank you.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.840
But I never accept gifts.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.190
This isn't a gift.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.640
I'm just concerned about your health.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.210
Thank you,

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.840
but I have my principles.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.680
You have the night shift later, right?

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.460
Your profession is quite demanding.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:46.130
Serving the people!

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.830
It's all for serving the people.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.460
Alright, I'm leaving.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:55.350
Minister.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.740
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.200
My mom packed me some food.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.160
Authentic crab roe fried rice cakes.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.620
Would you like to try some?

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.500
No thanks. My car is already here.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.070
Night shifts are exhausting.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.330
Rest whenever you can.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.880
You're young, but you still need to
take care of your health too.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.440
Goodbye.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.220
You're here, Yi.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.470
Just you?

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.590
No.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.480
Just now, Mr. Wang, Zhou,

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:37.850
and his wife—

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
all our old friends—were here.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.280
We're having this dance party tonight

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.100
for no particular reason.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.230
I just wanted to hold a commemoration

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.790
because today is the club's last day.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:50.680
Who knows what this place

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.080
will turn into tomorrow?

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:56.840
Go turn on that gramophone.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.260
Zhaoyuan,

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:15.550
today is the last day

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.530
of Zihe's club.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.480
So many old friends came.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.110
Do you remember?

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.680
The New Year's ball of 1946,

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.180
the year
after the War of Resistance ended,

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:27.410
[1945-1946 New Year's Eve Ball]

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:29.100
was also held here.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.790
Fu Zihe, what are you doing?

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.830
No wonder you didn't want us to come over.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.350
Turns out Yi Yi is here.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.590
What are you talking about?

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.880
Yi Yi is my friend.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.000
Friend, huh?

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.210
Friends put their arms
around each other's shoulders?

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:00.010
How cozy, huh?

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.070
Yi Yi,

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.830
your husband is dead,

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.600
and you're out here
seducing someone else's husband?

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.270
Don't leave! Explain yourself!

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.620
No wonder you insisted on living nearby!

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.200
Convenient for you two, huh?

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.270
You seductress!

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.790
Stop talking! Please stop!

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:13.310
Yi Yi, I'm sorry.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.750
Yi Yi, you'd better explain yourself!

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.200
Yeah! What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.350
You do something wrong
and don't want others to talk about it?

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.350
Zhaoyuan was also a friend!

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.350
You know him!

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:21.330
"Friend"?

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.440
Your relationships are really complicated!

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.110
Let's go back and talk!
Let's talk at home.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.310
Talk at home? Why should we talk at home?

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.680
Yi Yi, go. You go first.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.310
Explain yourself right here!

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.310
Come home with me.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:29.680
Don't you dare leave! Explain yourself!

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.310
Explain what?

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.960
What are you doing?

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.470
Who should make what clear?

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.480
Listen up!

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.290
She is a martyr's widow,

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.460
my sister-in-law!

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.890
Watch your mouth!

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.240
Yi, don't be afraid. I'm here.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.030
Martyr's widow?

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:40.440
What?

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.270
-A martyr's widow?
-Stay away!

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.510
So what? Is she a martyr?

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:43.270
She's not the martyr herself!

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.240
Does being a martyr's widow
give her the right to seduce my husband?

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.400
Everyone knows
what kind of man Fu Zihe is!

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.200
Why take it out on my sister-in-law
instead of him?

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.460
I'm scolding her! What of it?

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.510
I'll scold her all I want!

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.240
Stop this annoying bickering!

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:53.720
Quiet!

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.260
I'm insulting her! You slut!

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.400
What... what did you say?

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:56.830
Slut!

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:57.550
We're insulting you!

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.160
Yes, you!

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:58.790
Slut!

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.400
You'll pay for this!

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.310
Fine! I'm waiting!

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.160
Stop it!
Are you trying to drive me to my death?

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.020
Say that again!

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.480
What do you want?

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.640
One, two, three!

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:07.160
Who are you calling names?

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.000
One for each of you! Say that again!

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.590
Still won't shut up?

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:10.510
I'll call the police!

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.310
Stop talking!

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.440
I'll report that you assault people!

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.160
We're calling the police!

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:13.790
Comrade Yunqing!

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:14.440
Comrade Yunqing.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.700
Don't call me comrade!

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.160
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.400
I didn't expect this to happen.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.030
Shut up.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.000
I'll go apologize to Yi Yi.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:21.680
Shut up.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:22.790
Go home.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.420
Go...

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.880
Go, go. We're going back now.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.240
You...

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:26.880
Go back!

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.800
Fine, we'll go back.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.510
You'll be the death of me.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:33.690
You're messing with us first!

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:34.890
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.430
How could my brother
have a friend like you?

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.880
Ms. Yi,

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.030
don't let what happened today

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:41.350
get to you.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.000
We all know

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.560
what kind of person you are.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.070
We don't believe a word of what they said.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.560
Here are the new designs.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.520
-Thank you.
-Yi!

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.310
I chased all those people away!

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.240
Don't be afraid!

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:57.590
Are you okay?

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.590
Thank you, Qing.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.140
Look how pale you are. Come on.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.530
Sit down and take a rest.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.050
Let me pour you some tea.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.720
Yi,

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.830
no need to thank me.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:09.920
I definitely believe you.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.450
I'll always be on your side.

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:13.880
These good-for-nothings are so irritating,

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.140
aren't they, Xiurong?

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.640
Exactly.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.220
Don't worry.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.150
They won't ever dare to do it again.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.610
Okay, thank you.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:22.840
What kind of tea is this?

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:23.880
Black tea.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.930
I love black tea.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:28.680
Why did you come so late?

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.030
Yi.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.510
Are all these books yours?

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.350
Let me take a look.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.350
A Russian book? That's impressive!

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.920
Can you teach me?

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.380
You want to learn Russian?

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.510
Sure.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.240
I'll teach you when I have time.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:47.770
Great.

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.720
What did you just ask me?

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.720
I asked why you came over so late.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:57.750
Right,

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.360
I wanted to tell you that...

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.200
About last time...

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.270
when you were supposed to share
my brother's stories at that activity,

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.510
you didn't do well.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:09.040
I think you must have been nervous.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.310
I came to encourage you.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.920
Next time!

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.680
Next time, you'll definitely do better!

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.940
You need to have confidence in yourself.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:15.830
Qing,

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.080
my feelings for your brother

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.310
are my privacy.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:20.880
I miss your brother,

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.620
but I keep that in my heart.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.960
I don't want to lay my heart bare
in public,

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.590
nor do I want to share

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.030
my pain with strangers.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.800
Can you understand that?

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.450
No, I can't understand.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.590
Yi,

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.750
something's seriously wrong
with your thinking right now.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.220
That's bourgeois thinking,

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.350
completely incompatible
with our proletarian values.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.440
My brother wasn't only your husband.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.720
He was also a revolutionary martyr,

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.920
a Communist Party member.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.480
He didn't belong only to you!

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.200
I'm sorry.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:49.440
In my eyes,

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.510
my bond with your brother is mine
and mine alone.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.440
No, how can you call it yours alone?

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:54.680
He was her husband

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.960
and also my brother,
Zhou Yunqing's brother!

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.920
Am I right, Xiurong?

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.480
Nod.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.030
Nod, come on!

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.510
See?

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:01.350
-Qing.
-She nodded!

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.920
If you want to share,

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.270
that's your freedom.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.830
I do want to share, Yi!

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.310
But they don't want to hear from me.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:10.200
The organization wants you to
tell us his stories!

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.640
You need to share, Yi!

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.680
I don't want to share.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.240
Why don't you want to share?

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.110
Why is your thinking so backward?

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.880
You need to accept my help!

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.790
Zhou.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.880
Ideological transformation
doesn't happen overnight.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.680
Let's give Ms. Yi a bit more time.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.940
I'll give you time.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.690
Two days.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.800
I'll take the designs with me.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.800
Get some rest.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:36.710
Ms. Yi.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.460
Minister Wen?

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.050
Am I disturbing your work?

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.150
Not at all.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.080
I'm just sketching casually.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.590
Please come in.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:56.000
Okay.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:00.030
Please have a seat.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.030
No need to fuss. No need.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.910
I just came from Fu Zihe's place.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.550
Now that I've seen you, I'm relieved.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.810
Your mental state isn't as he described.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.210
What did he say about me?

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.010
That I have suicidal tendencies?

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.970
You're very candid.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.880
Please sit. I'll make some tea.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.000
Okay.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.410
Thank you.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:00.600
He doesn't understand
what kind of person I am at all.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:05.590
I'm someone who has faced

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.890
life and death on the battlefield.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.960
I could go for days drinking only water

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.360
and not eating
just to buy an art book I love.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:16.130
When I went out to sketch,

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:17.550
I got lost.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.070
I got injured.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:22.440
And I wandered in the mountains
for 5 days,

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.590
barely hanging on,

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.690
yet I crawled my way back to Shanghai.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.590
I know.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.660
You're also someone who dared to

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.140
hand over your diary

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:40.390
without leaving yourself a way out.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.400
Yes.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.660
So I assume you definitely wouldn't mind

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.070
those vulgar words,

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.070
right?

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.000
You understand me.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.890
Su Xiurong said
she invited you to give a talk,

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:05.640
and you refused her.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:10.480
You should know why I refused.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.150
I know.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:13.960
I just want to tell you

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:16.280
that Comrade Su is a kind person.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.920
What she did

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.040
had no ill intent toward you.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.480
I know all that.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.920
So I'm not angry with her.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:26.960
I just can't make her understand

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.840
that grief, pain, and longing—

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.570
these are all personal emotions.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.560
They're buried deep inside here.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.740
I don't want others to touch them.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.560
They don't understand.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:42.440
Yeah.

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.680
That's why
you should interact with them more

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.530
so they can understand you.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.260
It's the New China now.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.720
The working class is the leading class.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.120
For intellectuals to survive and develop,

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.390
they must step out of their ivory towers

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.630
and connect with the masses.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:11.150
Those workers
who haven't had much education

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.760
are actually very thoughtful
and knowledgeable,

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.260
with rich life experiences

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.540
and deep emotions.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.320
If you communicate with them more,

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.710
they'll surely understand you.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.880
I know

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.740
you're now the official clothing designer

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.230
for the export workshop.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.920
I've used

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.760
this pen for a while.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.910
It feels good to use.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.570
I want you to have it.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:40.820
I hope you'll stay

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.150
and keep creating.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.880
I'm very curious.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.290
I heard you come from a prominent family.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.070
You're a top student
from Peking University,

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:51.590
a true intellectual.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.070
Later, you joined the revolution,
led troops in battle,

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:56.470
and became a professional revolutionary.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.860
How did you manage this transformation?

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.230
Was it hard?

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.670
Among our leadership,

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:02.960
there are many like me

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.360
who come from intellectual backgrounds.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.400
I believe it was the same faith

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.300
that brought us together.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.690
I don't expect you to be like us.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.920
I only hope

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:15.330
that here in Shanghai,

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.960
you can live happily

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.280
and create freely.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.230
But first,

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.690
you need to adapt to the times

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:22.890
and change yourself.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.030
Here.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.070
Your pen.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:35.830
I forgot to thank you.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:41.630
This...

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.400
This part tends to get loose sometimes.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.660
Just hold it tight while turning,
and it'll be fine.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.050
It's really nice to use.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.030
Thank you.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:39:59.400
Ms. Su,

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.550
I've revised the designs
the way you asked.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.610
Please take a look.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.590
I was just making some casual comments.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:08.710
You took it seriously?

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.400
Those weren't just casual comments.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.400
You were speaking from experience.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.000
Oh, right,

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.590
Comrade Zhou also felt that she

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:17.790
went too far that day,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.600
so she made you some tea eggs.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.840
Yi.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:22.660
Qing?

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.790
When did you get here?

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.240
I've been here for a while.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.770
I just went to the bathroom.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.150
I was wrong last time.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.470
These are tea eggs I made myself.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:36.020
Please eat them!

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:37.880
I just had a meal.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:40.280
E-Even if you just had a meal,
you must eat them.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.070
If you don't eat them,

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:42.590
it means you won't forgive me.

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:43.850
I'm really not hungry.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.810
Even if you're not hungry,
you have to eat!

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.630
I made these tea eggs myself.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.230
I can't even bear to eat them.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:54.930
Forget it.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.110
Eat them or not, I don't care.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:58.360
I regret coming here.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.670
Don't forgive me then!

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.150
Qing.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.360
What?

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:15.660
I have to eat it here?

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:18.480
Yes, right here!

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:26.440
You're not hungry,

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.110
but I'm actually getting a bit hungry.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:28.640
Xiurong,

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.960
both of the eggs are for my sister-in-law.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.070
Stingy.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:33.900
Come on, take a bite.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.310
Take a bite.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.630
See that?

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.550
My sister-in-law ate my tea egg!

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:41.480
She forgave me!

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:43.610
Applaud.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:44.880
Clap!

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.030
Clap!

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.800
Eat them one by one.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.320
If you don't want the yolk, give it to me.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:00.890
Xiurong.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.280
She ate it all.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:05.880
Make more next time.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.720
I'll make one for each of you next time!

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.800
Take your time looking around.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.150
20% off for our grand opening.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.550
Take your time browsing.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.920
Mr. Qian!

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:22.880
Congratulations.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.670
Thank you. Thank you.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.000
Please come in. Come in.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.490
Take your time looking around.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:32.860
Director Chen.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:35.000
You're here too.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:36.720
Okay, okay.

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.070
Please come in. Please come in.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.670
Please come in. Please come in.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:40.620
Come in. Take your time.
