Shang Yunfei and his fiancÃ©e
Huang Yahui are missing.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.640
They're suspected of embezzling

We're currently looking for them.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.229
We'd like you
to cooperate with our investigation.

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.039
That can't be.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.090
What's your relationship

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.530
with Huang Yahui?

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.070
We're colleagues.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.680
Huang Yahui was a cashier at your unit.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.190
Every one of these transfers
bears your signature.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.560
Do you know

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.760
where the money went?

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.510
I signed them,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.200
but I didn't approve the project.

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.520
I was just doing my job,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.000
and I had no idea she was embezzling.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.920
Huang Yahui took out a personal loan,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.060
and you were her guarantor,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.990
is that correct?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.810
Since you were only colleagues,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.010
why did you agree to guarantee her loan?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.780
We had worked together for 3 years

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.230
and we got along well.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.190
Regarding Huang Yahui's case,

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.520
I advise you to voluntarily disclose
all relevant information.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.650
If you hide anything

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.470
and are subsequently classified
as an accomplice,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.800
you'll face severe legal repercussions.

Director.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.310
I'm so sorry.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.360
I never thought
something like this would happen.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.120
Go back to your dorm and rest for now.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.000
I'll wash up, get changed

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.190
and head to the bureau later.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.630
I'll see you there.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.860
You should take a few days off to rest.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.870
I... I don't need to rest.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.150
This is a critical time
for my promotion review.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.560
I absolutely can't fall behind on work.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.950
There's no need to rush back for work.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.280
Just take a few days off.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.620
Director,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.290
what do you mean by that?

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.710
Given what happened to Huang Yahui,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.420
the bureau is holding
an emergency meeting right now.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.550
I'm afraid that
the situation doesn't look good for you.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.630
You've been at the bureau
for 3 years now.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.760
Do you really think the bureau

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.079
will just let it go after Huang Yahui

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.880
made such a huge mess and ran off?

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.520
Ye,

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.080
your promotion is off the table,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.160
and you'll probably be held accountable.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.020
Huang Yahui is the biggest embezzler

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.460
our bureau has ever had.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.370
Besides, the bureau believes

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.780
her embezzlement was enabled

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.920
by certain officials' dereliction of duty.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.779
Do you know
what the crime of dereliction of duty is?

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.480
The country has zero tolerance for it.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.240
As the police said,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.030
if they find anything on you,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.460
you could go to jail, too.

Are you thirsty?

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.070
No, Grandma.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.840
I know everything that's happened to you.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.030
I want to tell you a story

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.950
about my aunt.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.390
Maybe it will help you

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.680
after you hear it.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.940
I remember
it was a hot summer in Shanghai.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.400
My grandfather never got to see the person

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.330
he was waiting for before he passed.

[1936, Shanghai]

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.130
I knew who he was waiting for.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.770
It was my aunt,
who was studying in Germany at the time.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.290
Becoming a doctor

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.360
was my father's and my shared dream.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.930
All these years,

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.010
my father hid his illness
and our family's struggles

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.680
so I could focus on my studies abroad.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.270
I never expected

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.630
everything to happen so suddenly.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.120
May I ask your name, miss?

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.390
My surname is Lin.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.540
You're beautiful.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.120
Do you have a ride?

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:02.430
Yes, I do.

They're yours now.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.750
I bought them in the U.K.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.990
You didn't bring me any gifts
for my homecoming?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.800
Let's go home.

Miss,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.940
what's in these suitcases?

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.140
Why are they so heavy?

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.960
It's all medical equipment
I brought back from Germany.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.270
You two take one.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.340
I'll carry this one myself.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.120
The waves were too rough on the way back,

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.549
so it took a few extra days.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.120
How are things with your grandpa?

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.790
My dad took care of everything.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.390
How's the rest of the family?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.160
They're fine.

Indeed.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.410
You've grown up,

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.870
and you're even more beautiful.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.030
Do you remember this bike?

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.050
I used to take you out
on it when you were little.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.380
I specially rode it here
just to pick you up.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.910
Come on, I'll take you home.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:10.750
I do remember.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.000
But...

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.360
I have Yi and Xiu with me.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.190
We can take a rickshaw back.

Let's go.

She's really grown up.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.790
Dad.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.520
I'm home.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.080
Siyun,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.720
have you contacted the Qiao family?

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.080
Not yet.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.640
I'll go with you tomorrow
to visit the Qiao family.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.830
There's no need to rush.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.200
How can you say that?

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.080
Your marriage arrangement
with the Qiao family

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.410
has been postponed again and again
because of your studies.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.960
Now that Dad's gone,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.000
what if the Qiao family changed their mind

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.660
and canceled the engagement?

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.540
What would we do then?

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.320
Jinghan,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.920
Dad just passed away.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.780
Is this really the right time
to talk about this?

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.790
Alright,

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.010
you're right.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:30.970
Madam,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.670
there's a group of people in the yard.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:34.750
Who are they?

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:36.030
I don't know.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.440
They seem to be from the Zeng family.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.790
Well,

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.340
I'll go check
on your sister-in-law upstairs.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.200
I'll go up and see how she's doing.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.120
Mrs. Lin.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:22.970
Madam,

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.960
I'm Mr. Zeng's lawyer,

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.750
Cheng Ao.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.710
I'm here to see Lin Jinghan
about something.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.760
Why is everyone so quiet?

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.560
Who's actually in charge here?

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.200
Here's the thing.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.080
Lin Jinghan owes Mr. Zeng money,

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.210
and it's been overdue for 6 months.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.640
He mortgaged your house as collateral.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.310
If he doesn't repay the debt,

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.550
we'll have to seize your property.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.550
We didn't mean to disturb you today.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.080
We just need to see Lin Jinghan.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.940
How much does Lin Jinghan owe you?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.330
Lin Jinghan isn't here.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.430
He hasn't been around for a long time.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:10.650
Search.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.030
Have we...

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.030
met before?

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:35.440
I don't know you.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.560
You're really beautiful.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.510
Yi,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.870
go upstairs and check on your mom.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.030
Call me if she shows any symptoms.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.480
Okay.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.570
I'll come right up.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.120
How much does Jinghan owe them?

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.160
Quite a lot, I think.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.000
It must be a significant amount.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.240
How much exactly?

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.960
A debt is a debtâwe can just repay it.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.820
Where would we get the money
to pay it back?

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.450
During the years your father was ill,

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.360
everyone avoided us.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.080
Now that your father is gone,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.010
who would even pay attention to us?

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.510
Even the banks are snobs,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.380
and they won't grant us a loan.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:28.690
It hurts.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.670
Xiu,

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.310
take my mom upstairs too.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.790
Ao,

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.130
no sign of Lin Jinghan on the first floor.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.400
Then search the second floor.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.400
When you find Lin Jinghan,
break one of his legs first.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:51.890
Let's go.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:56.620
It hurts.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:14:59.900
Ao,

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.120
we couldn't find him.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.630
This is my bedroom.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.110
You can't go in!

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.320
My sister-in-law is inside.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.780
She's about to give birth.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.350
I'm sorry.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.910
Lin Jinghan

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.330
must come with us.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.110
Try going in if you dare!

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.540
Is she going to cut you?

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.810
It seems like it.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:50.730
She wouldn't dare.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.630
He won't hurt you either.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.240
I know this man.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.560
He always keeps his word
and handles things professionally.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.090
Here, give me this cleaver.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:01.440
Be good.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.620
That was scary.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.040
She actually did it!

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.600
Do you want me to
shoot a bullet through your dimple?

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.450
Are you crazy?

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.680
Why are you bullying a girl?

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.820
She cut me.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.840
Didn't you bring that on yourself?

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.440
Auntie, my mom is in labor!

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.180
I'll give you 30 days.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:20.800
Tell Lin Jinghan.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.609
Get the money ready within 30 days.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.430
This is the final deadline.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.640
Let's go.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.550
Boss says we're leaving.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:37.310
Get lost!

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.500
Are you leaving or not?

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.780
Let's go!

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.730
I need a quick bandage.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.000
Is it a boy or a girl?

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.960
Does it matter?

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.060
No, it doesn't.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.550
Siyun,

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.200
with all this chaos at home today,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.720
thank goodness you're here
to help deliver the baby.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.610
Great.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.680
It's a boy.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.470
Our Lin family finally has an heir.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:45.750
He's so beautiful.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.750
He looks just like your dad

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.720
when he was just born.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.350
I think he looks more like my mom.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.080
What's wrong with your eyes?

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.040
Sister-in-law.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.510
Yi,

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:00.880
get your mother a glass of water.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.680
Okay.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.640
How are you feeling?

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.880
I'm fine.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.360
Where's Lin Jinghan?

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.310
I... I'm here.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.910
Down here.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.350
Here.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.910
Siyun,

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.530
are they all gone?

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.550
How did you make them leave?

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:24.680
Tell me about it.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.840
How did you get in there?

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.000
Mom,

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.110
Xiu and Yi,

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.200
they lifted the bedboard for me.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.910
In that critical moment,

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.240
I crawled in here.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.850
Why didn't you tell me
you owed so much money?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.550
Well, you just got back,

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.310
I needed time to tell you.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.480
I just heard

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.120
that you're in charge of the family now.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.870
Do you have a good plan
to help me repay the debt?

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.360
You owe the money.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:55.410
Yes, right.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.790
I didn't mean anything else.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.070
I know I owe the money.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.780
But aren't you
marrying into the Qiao family?

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.560
The Qiao family owns a huge bank.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.600
Surely you can help me.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.130
Please help me.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.970
Tell me if you have any good ideas.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.100
You owe the money,

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.300
so you pay it back yourself.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.230
What's wrong with her?

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.190
Mom,

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.070
come here,

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.960
come here.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.200
Help me lift

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.470
this bed board

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.380
so I can get out.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.880
I'm suffocating down here.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.550
Jinghan,

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.150
take a look at your son!

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:33.830
He looks so much like you.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.160
I see himâhe does look like me.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.310
Lift the bed board

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.000
and get me outâI can barely breathe!

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.440
This child is really beautiful.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.550
Yes, yes, he is.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:41.270
But I'm stuck in here,

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.240
-and I can't even see him.
-He looks just like you.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.110
Hey, I just realized that

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.030
you've forgotten your own son
since you got a grandson.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.650
How could you do this to me?

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.680
I know I'm in debt,
but you can't treat me like this!

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.740
Look at those eyes.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.840
They're exactly like yours.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.130
We came all this way for nothing today.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.030
We didn't collect the debt.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.310
How are you going to explain this
to my dad when you get back?

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.160
It's fine.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.400
I'll talk to him.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.910
You're still so aggressive.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.250
You always act recklessly,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.710
doing whatever you want without thinking.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.750
Since when do you hit women?

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.280
I've been different from others
since I was a kid.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.100
Do you know about a hormone

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:32.820
called adrenaline?

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.240
My adrenaline levels

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.080
are higher than average,

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.070
so I'm prone to high blood pressure.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.480
Is high blood pressure contagious?

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.030
Your friend seems short-tempered too.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.410
You're Jin, right?

00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.790
How's your blood pressure?

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:00.790
It's normal.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.480
That's good.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.920
From now on, when we're out,
speak when you should,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.350
and keep quiet

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.810
when you shouldn't.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.270
Jin,

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:15.590
make a toast to Ao.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.030
Ao, here's to you.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.260
Cheers, Cheng.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.270
Get lost!

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.980
Say that again, I dare you.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.270
Stop, stop.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.200
I just got back.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:30.920
How about this?

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.790
I'll dance for you guys.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.070
Follow me.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.070
Have some tea.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.310
Shijun,

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.690
long time no see.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.420
You've studied abroad too.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.330
Do you approve of arranged marriages?

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.010
Do you think we could be happy

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:35.880
if we got married?

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.530
When I was in middle school,
I promised Siyun

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.040
that I would make her

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.870
the happiest bride in Shanghai.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:45.530
Everyone laughed at me back then,

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.110
but I meant it.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:50.030
A big reason I went to study abroad later

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.350
was actually because of Siyun.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.440
I thought we could go together

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.600
and look out for each other.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.730
But I never expected

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.520
she would go to Germany
while I went to America.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.680
A girl alone in a foreign country

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.310
must have suffered much more than I did.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.620
I don't approve of arranged marriages.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:08.720
But Siyun,

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.500
could you give me, Qiao Shijun, a chance?

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.280
Let's get to know each other again.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.550
Yes, of course.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.350
Well said.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.500
Marriage is a big deal,
and it should be decided by parents.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.040
Do you remember
when you two were kids, building blocks

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.350
and holding hands?

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.980
Now that you've grown up,

these are my favorite dishes?

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.150
Siyun,

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:04.510
my father would like to invite you
to our home for dinner tonight.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:05.590
Please prepare for it.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:07.590
I'll have someone come pick you up later.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.400
Shijun,

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:10.630
Xiu is dead.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.950
I need to take care of her funeral

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:14.740
and the lawsuit.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.650
I won't be able to make it to dinner.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:19.520
Who is Xiu?

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.080
My nanny's daughter.

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:26.130
Alright,

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.710
then you should
take care of Xiu's matter first.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:29.910
Don't be too sad.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.110
Take care of yourself
and don't wear yourself out.

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.040
My condolences.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.510
Thank you.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.550
Was that my future brother-in-law
on the phone?

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.300
Are you having dinner with him tonight?

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.610
You should eat, drink,

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.550
and enjoy your time.

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:51.250
Why don't you go by yourself?

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.390
Is this Dr. Lin Siyun's residence?

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.290
I'm Ling, a midwife from Zhongde Hospital.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:59.470
The director asked me to inform you

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.490
that your job application
has been approved.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:03.140
You can come to the hospital next Monday
to handle the paperwork.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:03.820
Okay,

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:05.750
I understand.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:13.160
Was that Shijun on the phone again?

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.760
Siyun, listen to me.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:18.870
Would I ever harm you?

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.670
I'm your own brother.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.320
Let me tell you.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.730
Tonight, you...

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.030
Tonight,

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.250
you must go to have dinner with him.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.320
If you offend him,

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.590
it'll affect the wedding.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.510
Most importantly,
it's about the Lin family's legacy.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.510
Do you hear me?

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.230
Mom,

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:44.620
I want to postpone the wedding.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:51.890
Why do you want to postpone it?

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.880
Xiu was murdered.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:56.670
Yes, I'm also sad

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:57.980
that Xiu died.

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:00.550
But at the end of the day,
wasn't she just an outsider?

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:02.680
Can't you tell what's more important?

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.280
If you keep messing around like this,

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.710
the Lin family will be ruined by you
sooner or later!

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:07.710
Have you no shame?

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:11.050
Is it me ruining the family or you?

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.400
Siyun,

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.720
just listen to your brother.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:16.960
Don't worry about Xiu's case for now.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.510
Let Jinghan handle it,

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:19.400
okay?

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:22.690
All he wants is for the Qiao family
to pay off his debts.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.230
How can he be so despicable?

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.710
Since you put it that way,

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:30.370
then we need to have a real talk

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.670
in front of our mom.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.960
You've had the finest food and drinks
since childhood.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.760
We never mistreated you, right?

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.620
That's because of the Lin family.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.750
Sending you abroad

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:44.280
to study,

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.880
getting a foreign education,

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.400
having all that knowledge to show off...

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.530
that's also because of the Lin family.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.670
People...

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.380
shouldn't forget where they came from.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:55.130
You're right.

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:58.960
The reputation earned
by the Lin family's ancestors

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.560
and the upbringing they gave me

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.820
mean I must repay them.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.470
But I'm repaying the Lin family

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.510
and my parents.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.500
Why should I have to
pay off the debts you owe?

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.890
By the way,

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.160
I was sent abroad
on a government scholarship.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.820
I worked to support myself
in Germany for 4 years

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.660
and didn't spend a cent
of the family's money.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.820
You've been in business for years.

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.760
Have you earned anything?

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.880
The Lin family served as officials
for generations,

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.770
and remained wealthy for over a century.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:31.820
Now creditors are coming
to our door to collect debts.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.350
Our reputation is damaged,

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:35.450
and we can't even keep our residence.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.940
Whose fault is this, really?

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.530
Who squandered the Lin family's fortune?

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.940
Ao,

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.060
I'd like to report something to you.

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:14.150
Go ahead.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.000
The day the Lin family's maid died,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.800
Young Master didn't go to the theater.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.950
That son of the Liu family

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.550
picked him up to go drinking.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:22.510
And he took you along as well?

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:23.230
Yes, he did.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:26.880
Then who drove his car?

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.610
I don't know.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.180
Alright, I got it.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.000
Ao,

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:39.710
this is a big deal.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.400
Should we tell Master?

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.790
With Dalun's personality,

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.690
if he's determined to do this,

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:48.300
telling Master won't help.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.690
That's true.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.850
Dalun...

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.010
is hard to deal with.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:55.760
So what should we do?

00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.750
Don't worry. Let me think about it.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.380
What do you want?

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.150
Do you have coffee here?

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.760
No.

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.710
Who would drink coffee this late at night?

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.240
About Zeng Dalun's case...

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.270
you're his defense lawyer, right?

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.960
The eldest daughter of the Lin family
came to see me today.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.380
She said she's going to publish a report

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.580
alleging that Dalun murdered her maid.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.000
As you know,

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.180
our paper has
the biggest circulation in Shanghai.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.110
The Zeng family may be powerful,

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.770
but the victim was only a maid.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.170
If this gets published,

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:44.970
it will cause such public outrage

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:46.100
and social pressure

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.360
that when you go to court,

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.710
hundreds of people will be outside,
blocking the courthouse.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:52.510
How could you possibly win that case?

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.770
It will influence the judge's decision.

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:57.660
So tell me, should I publish it or not?

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.120
You must not publish this.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:01.850
Fine,

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:02.910
I won't.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:04.760
But,

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.220
putting our past as classmates aside,

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.800
based on my experience,

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.570
this piece would sell extremely well.

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.360
If I don't publish this,

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:16.840
what am I supposed to tell

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:19.030
my editor-in-chief when he asks?

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.300
How about this?

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:23.730
Lu Yingchen,

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.420
I'll buy every last copy
of whatever you publish

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:28.860
in tomorrow's paper.
