00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.752
If this wasn’t an accident,

00:00:01.784 --> 00:00:04.360
then someone really wanted you dead.

00:00:04.384 --> 00:00:05.240
What do you remember?

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:06.832
I don’t even want to remember anything.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.464
It’s not like there’s anyone at home
to take care of you, is it?

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.216
I can take care of myself.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.536
Mom, Dad.

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:18.936
No!

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.880
I think you should disappear for a while.

00:00:25.904 --> 00:00:26.928
Where else can I go?

00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:28.224
Mae Hong Son.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.224
Why Mae Hong Son?

00:00:29.248 --> 00:00:31.352
In goes there every year.

00:00:31.368 --> 00:00:32.848
I’m coming to Mae Hong Son with you.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.992
No one can know that Thap’s going to
Mae Hong Son, aside from us.

00:00:47.184 --> 00:00:49.344
Not even Karn or Pokpong.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.232
If anyone asks,

00:00:50.248 --> 00:00:52.060
just say he’s working in Singapore.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.984
Thap, my dear.

00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:59.128
Why is this happening to you?

00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:01.530
Take care of yourself, okay?

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.910
In.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.984
Please look after Thap, dear.

00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:18.672
Please.

00:01:18.688 --> 00:01:20.168
Look after him, please.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.170
Please?

00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:28.760
Yes, ma’am.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.536
And you take care of yourself too.

00:01:36.568 --> 00:01:40.040
If anything comes up,
you can always talk to Thap.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.912
Thap, be there for him.

00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:47.936
Thanks so much, dear.

00:01:54.216 --> 00:01:55.640
Please take care of my brother.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.744
Thanks a lot, dear.

00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:14.872
Hey! What are you doing?

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.928
Don’t keep the music to yourself.

00:02:16.968 --> 00:02:19.104
Like it’s not already awkward enough.

00:02:29.488 --> 00:02:30.488
Shit.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.160
Why’d you stop?

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.968
Sorry. Still not used to the car.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.976
Hey, where are you going?

00:02:54.024 --> 00:02:55.144
The market.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.808
You can’t.

00:02:56.856 --> 00:02:58.936
You’re on the run, not on vacation.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.640
I’ll just be quick. Ten minutes, max.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.984
If you want to come, cut the engine.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.624
The one thing to watch out for
with my brother is shopping.

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:21.168
He’s a shopaholic.

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:22.752
The top spender.

00:03:22.776 --> 00:03:24.312
You must keep an eye on him.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.576
Never let him near a market!

00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:32.856
Damn it.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.624
One bag of unsweetened soy milk, please.

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:38.696
Do you want one?

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.912
Mine is regular sweet, please

00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:42.632
Make that two bags with no sugar, please.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.680
Then I don’t want it anymore.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.439
Come on. How about less sweet?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.872
Sugar’s not good for you.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.780
Up to you then.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.192
Okay.

00:03:54.224 --> 00:03:58.024
One no sugar, one less sweet, please.

00:03:58.048 --> 00:04:00.020
That’ll be 20 baht.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.776
Thank you.

00:04:15.272 --> 00:04:16.112
Would you like some oranges?

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:17.144
They’re really sweet.

00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:18.168
Yes, please.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.504
Your outfits match. Are you two a couple?

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.944
I told you to change this morning.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.176
I only have one suitcase.

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:41.688
You’re the one who should’ve changed.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.584
300 baht, please.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.512
Here’s 300.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.624
Thank you.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:50.440
Thanks.

00:04:50.472 --> 00:04:52.440
Done? Can we go now?

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.376
Wait. One more stop.

00:04:56.144 --> 00:04:57.144
Hey.

00:05:02.704 --> 00:05:04.128
Hi there. Welcome.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.200
Do you have a first aid kit at home?

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.184
I don’t know. I’ve never bought one.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.568
So, that’s a no.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.448
Whoa.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.120
Are you hiding out or opening a clinic?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.944
Don’t buy so much. It’s just the two of us.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.030
This one included?

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.888
This is everything.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.936
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.872
This is all I need, sir.

00:05:51.896 --> 00:05:52.896
Sure.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.928
That’ll be 780 baht.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.752
Already paid.

00:06:05.768 --> 00:06:06.944
Thank you so much.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.648
Thap.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.680
Hm?

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.336
Let me give you a warning.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.690
About what?

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.032
Don’t fall for him.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.056
What are you talking about?

00:06:34.104 --> 00:06:35.160
I know…

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.360
that’s your type.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.088
Soft and fluffy, just how doctors like ‘em.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.120
Asshole.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.800
Just go already.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.840
(Soft and fluffy, just how doctors like ‘em.)

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:52.940
Stunning.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.400
Hey, can I borrow your phone?

00:08:55.424 --> 00:08:56.200
I want some pictures.

00:08:56.256 --> 00:08:57.256
No.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.152
You can’t use phones.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.016
Dao asked me to give you this.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.240
What?

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.944
Hey, aren’t you excited to
see this breathtaking view?

00:09:10.232 --> 00:09:11.232
No.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.440
I don’t like sunsets.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.936
You take everything out of the car.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.650
My wrist hurts.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.608
Now it hurts, huh?

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.568
Nice house.

00:09:55.608 --> 00:09:56.784
It’s clean.

00:09:56.808 --> 00:09:57.968
Does someone live here?

00:09:58.016 --> 00:09:58.872
No.

00:09:58.904 --> 00:10:00.760
I left the key with someone to take care of it.

00:10:00.784 --> 00:10:01.408
Hm?

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.440
Aren’t you worried?

00:10:02.552 --> 00:10:04.380
The locals here are trustworthy.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.640
You don’t have to believe me.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.280
You don’t believe in anything anyway.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.024
Where should I put my things?

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.140
Follow me.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.984
This is your bedroom.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:30.210
Okay.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.984
Gosh.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.288
Make yourself comfortable.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.360
And… no interaction necessary.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.552
One more thing, keep away from my stuff.

00:10:48.968 --> 00:10:49.968
Got it?

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.430
Okay.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:59.810
Okay.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.288
(He doesn’t have any relatives.)

00:12:11.312 --> 00:12:12.936
(I’m the only one he has.)

00:12:54.216 --> 00:12:55.672
I’m back.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.992
Move. Let me do it.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.760
Are you here to help, or just to eat?

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.624
To help, of course.

00:14:38.656 --> 00:14:42.368
Seeing your hand, I figured it might be
tomorrow before you get to eat.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.130
Great. Then that mouth isn’t allowed to eat.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.344
Hey, you have any vegetables?

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:03.790
What?

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.480
It’s a vegetable.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:10.792
Gosh!

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.590
Okay.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.584
Starting tomorrow, I’m in charge of the food.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.424
Is this going to be edible?

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.440
You’ll find out.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.472
Oh, it’s hot.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.560
I’ll wash the dishes.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.720
Good. I don’t like washing dishes.

00:16:13.744 --> 00:16:15.248
And housework in general.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.384
Besides, my wrist still hurts.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.960
It only hurts at convenient times.

00:16:19.984 --> 00:16:21.624
Didn’t seem to hurt when you were eating.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.120
I’ve decided you’ll do all the work

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.096
to pay rent and make up for my injury.

00:16:29.128 --> 00:16:30.128
Wait.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.360
Is this a sanctuary or a sweatshop? Huh?

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.960
Make yourself at home.

00:16:34.984 --> 00:16:36.024
I’m going to take a shower.

00:16:36.048 --> 00:16:37.048
Wait!

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.264
You just finished eating.

00:16:39.288 --> 00:16:40.384
Don’t shower yet.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.380
Look.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.456
Well?

00:16:53.488 --> 00:16:54.488
Feeling bloated?

00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:00.488
I told you to keep warm
after eating for digestion,

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.080
not jump into a cold shower.

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:06.360
“It’s just the two of us.”

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:07.770
“Why make such a fuss?”

00:17:07.808 --> 00:17:09.590
“Are you opening a clinic?”

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.592
And look, your hair’s still damp.

00:17:16.624 --> 00:17:17.744
Go dry it.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.984
I thought my dad was dead.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:32.950
Move.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.520
I’ll use the fan in my room.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.430
Want to increase your chances
of catching a cold?

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.136
I didn’t bring a hair dryer.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.420
I did.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.264
Go downstairs to my room, open the door.

00:17:55.296 --> 00:17:57.176
Look left. It’s right in front of the mirror.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.540
Ouch!

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.520
Why is the bathroom floor soaking wet?!

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.696
It’s called a bathroom for a reason!

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.240
What a nerd.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.140
You’re looking too comfortable.

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:14.350
Didn’t you tell me to
make myself comfortable?

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.680
Fine.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.720
Shirtless on the mountain in winter?

00:19:17.744 --> 00:19:18.824
You’ll see.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.020
Wait.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.536
Are you sure you dried your hair?

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.072
It’s still soggy.

00:19:55.096 --> 00:19:57.240
Go. Do it again.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.072
It’ll dry soon.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.300
Dry?

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.270
Fine.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.280
Leave your hair wet on the mountain
in winter? You’ll see.

00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:18.280
“Leave your hair wet on the mountain
in winter? You’ll see.”

00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:26.816
Gosh, it’s cold.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.872
Damn it.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.568
If you’re here to rub it in, don’t.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.740
I brought you rice porridge and some meds.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.020
Ow.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.490
Here.

00:21:25.888 --> 00:21:26.424
Ah.

00:21:26.464 --> 00:21:27.768
No more blowing on it.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.680
I’m hungry.

00:21:33.576 --> 00:21:35.580
Is this what you eat every morning?

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:38.490
No.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.648
I just wanted you to get something nutritious.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.080
Mm.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.480
Mm.

00:21:54.424 --> 00:21:57.784
Once you’re done eating, I’ll change for you.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:01.670
What?

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.680
I meant the elastic bandage.

00:22:04.712 --> 00:22:06.032
What were you thinking, kiddo?

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:08.630
Swear you weren’t implying anything?

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.160
Give it.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.296
I can eat by myself.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.540
So your wrist’s not hurting anymore?

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:31.720
I can manage.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.140
Are you going to keep staring?

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.512
Try moving your hand. See if it still hurts.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:47.184
I still feel it throbbing.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.952
Cheeky, aren’t you?

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.136
Are you crazy? I didn’t mean it that way.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.936
Don’t move too much.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.992
Want to keep the bandage on
so you'll be more careful?

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.160
No, it’s annoying.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:14.696
The bandage’s annoying?

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.216
The doctor is.

00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:29.592
Good.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.020
He’s got some fight in him.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.888
Should be fun living together.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:39.312
Hi, everyone.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.560
Hello.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.344
Mr. Village Chief.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:46.910
Auntie Pian.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:48.400
Hey!

00:24:48.432 --> 00:24:49.592
Hello, Auntie Pian.

00:24:49.616 --> 00:24:50.616
In, dear.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.912
Goodness!

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.704
When did you get here?

00:24:56.736 --> 00:24:57.272
Huh?

00:24:57.304 --> 00:24:58.256
Last night.

00:24:58.296 --> 00:24:59.640
Come on in.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.752
Why’d you bring so much stuff?

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.128
The Village Chief and Khaohom
aren’t home?

00:25:11.504 --> 00:25:13.500
The chief’s out
helping the villagers on the farm.

00:25:13.528 --> 00:25:14.728
Khaohom’s at school.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.896
Hey, In.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:18.032
Why don’t you stay until she gets back?

00:25:18.056 --> 00:25:21.504
She keeps saying
she misses you every single day.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.672
I’ll come back to visit another time.

00:25:26.376 --> 00:25:28.864
Oh, and about your
parents’ death anniversary,

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.496
want me to handle the food for
the merit-making, like I always do?

00:25:34.536 --> 00:25:36.540
Please let me trouble you with that.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.344
It’s no trouble at all.

00:25:38.376 --> 00:25:40.000
You’re not bothering me one bit.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.880
Since you’re back,
why not stay longer this time?

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.392
Didn’t you already graduate?

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.752
Oh, have you eaten yet?

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:49.928
Come, have some noodles.

00:25:49.952 --> 00:25:50.780
I’m making you one.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.160
Come here.

00:25:52.544 --> 00:25:53.968
Auntie Pian.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.368
I’ll have to excuse myself today.

00:25:56.408 --> 00:25:58.080
You’re acting strange this time.

00:25:58.112 --> 00:26:00.200
You never turn me down.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.568
Is someone waiting for you?

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.272
I’m just teasing.

00:26:07.304 --> 00:26:10.272
Go do what you need to. I’ll see you later.

00:26:10.408 --> 00:26:11.408
Sure.

00:26:11.752 --> 00:26:13.176
Goodbye, Auntie.

00:26:13.208 --> 00:26:15.180
See you. Be on your way.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:17.632
Yes? What is it?

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.664
I’m coming.

00:26:19.944 --> 00:26:21.320
Sorry.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.280
My beloved In came. I got carried away.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.368
What can I get you?

00:26:24.408 --> 00:26:25.624
One more bowl?

00:26:25.656 --> 00:26:26.856
Same as the last?

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.740
Hello?

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.060
Doc.

00:27:01.624 --> 00:27:02.624
No.

00:27:06.272 --> 00:27:07.272
Doc!

00:27:10.032 --> 00:27:11.376
Damn it.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.140
Doc!

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.040
Doc!

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:33.530
Doc!

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.736
Yeah? What is it?

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.768
Where have you been?

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.480
I took a walk around the house.

00:27:41.504 --> 00:27:42.760
You out of your mind?

00:27:42.792 --> 00:27:44.376
You think you’re on a trip?

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.000
- When will it sink in that you’re on the run?
- Hey, hey, chill.

00:27:47.024 --> 00:27:48.008
Calm down.

00:27:48.048 --> 00:27:50.352
I was just here. Don’t overreact.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.848
Stop thinking only about yourself.

00:27:52.888 --> 00:27:55.568
What do you expect me to tell Dao
if something happens to you?

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:57.960
It’s not your problem, is it?

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.144
Fine. Great.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:02.528
Do what you please.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.056
Go die wherever you want.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.032
I’m worried about Thap.

00:28:15.056 --> 00:28:16.504
If something happened to him,

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:18.032
my family would definitely fall apart.

00:28:18.056 --> 00:28:19.792
Please look after Thap.

00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:22.030
Please look after him.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.136
Yes, ma’am.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.140
Ouch.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.656
I’d like to...

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.680
Don’t apologize.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.248
I’m to blame too.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.544
I’d like to have… the ketchup.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.720
I’m really sorry.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.240
Guess I’m still not used to all this.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.920
I’m sorry, too. I was being too harsh.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.460
You care about me?

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.352
In your dreams.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:38.930
Who cares about you?

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.280
After we eat,

00:31:45.312 --> 00:31:46.776
let’s lay down some ground rules.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.832
Before one of us ends up killing the other.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.260
Good idea.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.368
I need you to understand that
you came here because you’re in danger.

00:32:35.984 --> 00:32:37.980
You have to be more careful.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.220
Okay.

00:32:43.096 --> 00:32:44.096
Check it off too.

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.352
I’ve been on my own for so long,

00:32:49.368 --> 00:32:51.808
I might not be used to
having someone living with me.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.464
So what do I have to do?

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:55.690
Stop nagging.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.584
That’s called a friendly warning.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.728
Yeah, that.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.624
I don’t like a wet bathroom floor.

00:33:06.648 --> 00:33:07.856
Even for a little bit.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.472
Okay.

00:33:10.512 --> 00:33:12.470
I don’t like anyone messing with my stuff.

00:33:12.496 --> 00:33:13.392
Okay.

00:33:13.416 --> 00:33:16.072
Oh, right. This is the most important part:

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.112
I’m solely in charge of the food.

00:33:20.144 --> 00:33:23.952
What about dishwashing?

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.352
We wash our own dishes.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.176
Well, my wrist’s been hurting lately.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:34.820
Okay.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.112
Since your hand’s injured, I’ll do the dishes.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.960
Actually, I can handle all the housework.

00:33:46.992 --> 00:33:48.336
I like doing it.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.110
Write that down, then.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.688
Why do I feel like
I’m being tricked into working?

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.344
Hey, don’t overthink it.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:00.432
Anything else?

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.128
That’s it.

00:34:04.632 --> 00:34:05.968
Am I making the right choice?

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.224
Do we really have to be this discreet?

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.456
You can’t be too careful.

00:34:35.496 --> 00:34:37.880
What was it you wanted to show me?

00:34:43.464 --> 00:34:44.704
MRS. TARA RAKVANIT
DIGOXIN 0.25 MG, ONE TABLET DAILY

00:34:44.728 --> 00:34:46.248
Where did you get this?

00:34:46.632 --> 00:34:48.630
Mrs. Tara’s housekeeper gave it to me.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.808
She felt sorry for her employer.

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:55.992
So…

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.872
What’s Kasidis been up to?

00:34:57.904 --> 00:34:59.960
Heard anything about him?

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.104
When he found out Thap was in Singapore,

00:35:03.128 --> 00:35:05.100
he sent his men after him.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:09.312
And… what’s your plan to handle that?

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:11.144
Nothing.

00:35:11.176 --> 00:35:13.008
I’m just gathering more evidence.

00:35:13.056 --> 00:35:14.256
Let him dance.

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:15.570
That means…

00:35:16.688 --> 00:35:18.328
Thap isn’t really in Singapore?

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.576
Well…

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.848
You don’t trust me?

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:29.290
It’s not that.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:33.232
I just need to keep anyone
not involved out of this case.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.744
Right.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.360
So I’m not involved.

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:45.024
I care about you.

00:35:47.176 --> 00:35:49.180
I don’t want you caught up in this.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.064
It’s dangerous.

00:36:28.016 --> 00:36:29.016
Oh, shit.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.632
What the hell.

00:36:48.744 --> 00:36:50.400
Hey, what are you doing?

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.408
The chair’s broken, so I’m fixing it.

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.496
I told you not to mess with my stuff.

00:36:59.536 --> 00:37:01.256
Can’t we just stay out of each other’s way?

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:03.090
In.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.720
Why do you have to
interfere with everything?

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.048
I’m just fixing a chair.

00:37:09.088 --> 00:37:10.480
Is it yours?

00:37:10.504 --> 00:37:11.960
Did I ask you to fix it?

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.928
Didn’t I say to stay away from my things?

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.176
But it’s broken.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.328
Let it stay broken!

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:21.808
Everything in this house is already broken!

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.080
That’s exactly why I’m trying to fix it!

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:35.048
Do you think it’s easy to be back here?

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.560
What about the contract?

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.968
The one we made.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:43.960
We have an agreement.

00:37:43.992 --> 00:37:45.552
Why are you still crossing the line?

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.448
Just back the f♪ck off, will you?

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.536
Dao, I can’t stay here anymore.

00:38:58.664 --> 00:39:00.208
(Thap, what did you do to In?)

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.344
(Just going back to that house every year
is hard enough for him as it is.)

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:08.712
(It’s the house where his parents used to live,
but now it’s empty.)

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:13.552
(Every time he returns there, he disappears
for days before he can be reached again.)

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:23.232
(Thap, I don’t know what happened,
but In’s loss isn’t something small.)

00:39:23.264 --> 00:39:26.360
(You’re a doctor, you know best, son.)

00:39:26.416 --> 00:39:28.360
(In’s been through so much.)

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:33.912
(Maybe your presence helps him
more than he lets on.)

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:56.120
(Did you touch anything of his?)

00:39:56.152 --> 00:39:58.224
(He doesn’t like it
when people touch his things.)

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.120
(Or did you fix something
that belonged to his parents, son?)

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:56.120
Why are you here?

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.376
Stay away.

00:41:13.056 --> 00:41:14.592
Stay away.

00:41:14.616 --> 00:41:15.928
Get out.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.672
I’m really sorry.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.168
I’m sorry for crossing the line.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.640
And I’m sorry I caused your injury again.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.784
It should’ve healed much sooner.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.232
From now on, I won’t meddle in
any of your business whatsoever.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.440
I promise.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.176
Can you finish fixing it?

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.660
What was that?

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.240
That chair.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:58.040
Can you fix it back the way it was?

00:43:19.128 --> 00:43:21.130
Have you ever talked to a doctor about…

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:28.160
your family?

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:32.568
Never.

00:43:38.944 --> 00:43:40.940
Maybe opening up about it would help.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.424
What you’ve faced isn’t something minor.

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:56.576
What kind of doctor are you?

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:01.136
Critical care.

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:05.488
What do you treat?

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:07.688
All critical cases.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.048
Aren’t you stressed?

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.040
Of course, I am.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.392
So damn much.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.168
Is that why you seem
so indifferent about death?

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.712
No one can be indifferent to death.

00:44:31.856 --> 00:44:33.860
But I have to see it as something normal.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.624
Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to live with it.

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:44.336
Do you play guitar?

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:46.312
I used to.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.376
Don’t really know how anymore.

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:50.830
That’s not true.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.288
I know you do. Very well, even.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.744
You love your guitar so much.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.176
In all the pictures in your room,

00:45:01.888 --> 00:45:03.890
you’re always holding it.

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:05.950
Right?

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:17.248
My mom liked it.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:20.952
She loved listening to me play.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:28.040
This chair was my mom and dad’s favorite.

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:39.890
In,

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.968
do you know the hardest part
of being a doctor?

00:45:54.440 --> 00:46:02.344
It’s accepting that bad things
can happen to good people.

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.000
Even though we know it’s not fair,

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:08.760
it’s the truth.

00:46:21.128 --> 00:46:23.130
The same goes for losing a family member.

00:46:24.192 --> 00:46:26.190
Even though it’s a big deal,

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:28.008
I believe…

00:46:30.152 --> 00:46:31.872
it’s no one’s fault.

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:33.980
No.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.168
It’s really my fault.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.460
In,

00:46:44.128 --> 00:46:47.744
I don’t know what you’ve been through.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.056
But I believe it’s not your fault at all.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:47:00.728
And I don’t know what memories
you have with the guitar or…

00:47:01.704 --> 00:47:02.768
this chair,

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:05.304
but don’t be angry with them.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.008
Don’t think of them as symbols of sadness.

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:24.960
It’s fixed.

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:40.032
The bathroom is all yours.

00:49:40.064 --> 00:49:41.064
Okay.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.880
Can I…

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.768
borrow the hair dryer?

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.880
Sure, it’s right where it usually is.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.952
Your hair is still wet.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.384
Jeez!

00:51:14.408 --> 00:51:15.928
That’s my face.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:21.312
Hey. It’s too strong.

00:51:31.392 --> 00:51:32.392
Thank you.

00:51:35.856 --> 00:51:37.640
Time to start calling me more casually.

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:43.128
We’re not close.

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:46.272
That’s alright. I’ll make sure we are.

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:53.390
Wait.

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:56.376
What now?

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:00.496
Good night, In.

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.640
- Holy shit!
- Shit!

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.288
Thap, I told you the lock is broken.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.352
Sorry. I forgot.

00:52:58.350 --> 00:52:59.350
Wait…

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:01.080
What did you just call me?

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.744
What did I call you? Doesn’t matter!

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.928
But I heard…

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.960
Hey!

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.568
You said my name.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.128
Now’s not the time.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:17.080
I’ll fix the door for you.

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.424
Yeah, you’re such a handy guy.

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:20.540
Unless you want to leave it broken.

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:22.784
No, fix it.

00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:24.504
Say it nicely.

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.184
Please fix it.

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:29.570
Good.

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:31.488
Come on, Mr. In.

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.784
I’m a doctor.

00:53:32.808 --> 00:53:36.344
Human bodies are just ordinary to me.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.536
Will you leave now?

00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:58.136
Will you stop smiling?

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.544
Smiling, my ass!

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:37.872
Can I borrow your phone?

00:54:37.896 --> 00:54:38.368
No.

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:40.152
Hey, don’t be stingy.

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:41.784
If you’re that bored, read something.

00:54:41.816 --> 00:54:42.624
Good.

00:54:42.648 --> 00:54:43.568
What?

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.752
It’s good, alright?

00:54:44.784 --> 00:54:46.320
Cute.

00:54:46.344 --> 00:54:47.552
Let’s get one thing straight first.

00:54:47.576 --> 00:54:48.344
Shoot.

00:54:48.368 --> 00:54:50.568
Don’t try to change
the villagers’ way of thinking.

00:54:50.592 --> 00:54:52.664
They’re performing a ritual to ask the spirit.

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.792
Why not ask the doctors?

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:55.640
Who are you?

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.440
Why are you here?

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.760
Shit, we’re screwed.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.304
I came here because of your dream, didn’t I?

00:55:00.328 --> 00:55:02.464
And the dream’s already passed.

00:55:02.496 --> 00:55:03.832
I had another one.

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.360
And I don’t know if I can help you in time.
