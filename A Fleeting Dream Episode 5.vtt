00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.509
Why are you home so late tonight?

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:14.439
I was talking
with the Lian family's steward.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.430
Then, I ran into Lian Xinya,
who caused some trouble.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.838
You've been too close
with that family's associates.

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:20.549
Too many want to come after you.

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:21.679
You need to be careful.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.279
With my skills,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.479
you don't need to worry.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.758
But you've been back
for quite some time now.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.118
How's the matter with Pei Yujie?

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.349
Any progress?

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.749
He is keeping too close
of a watch on me.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.910
If I want to bring him down,
I need more time.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.950
You met with Jiang Yao.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.070
How did you know?

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.069
I smelled the cologne he always uses.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.150
What are you? A hound?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.510
You're my fiancée in name.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.109
If you meet my niece's fiancé in private

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:09.949
and someone sees it,
we'll have unnecessary trouble.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.990
Unnecessary

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.789
trouble?

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.710
Pei Yuze.

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.118
Don't tell me you...

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:28.189
I'm not.

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.069
Uncle, why are you in the mood
to play chess with me today?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.830
A game of chess shows a man's nature.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.990
Yao.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.430
If you only attack head-on

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.389
and never look back,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.510
you may walk into danger
without ever knowing it.

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.549
Uncle, you're warning me with riddles.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.590
Do you think we have
some misunderstanding?

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:20.149
What is this?

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.069
Perfume I brought back from abroad.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.190
It's light and fresh.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.390
You're still a Pei.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.549
When you go out,
don't let the family lose face.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.150
Bad news!

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.639
Bad news!

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.598
Mr. Jiang, Second Master.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:39.999
News just came from the Lian family.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.350
They said Miss Xinruo's body
has been found.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.870
Du Youmeng?

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.278
Liar! How dare you come here?

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:10.949
Who is in this coffin?

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.390
My cousin, of course.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.789
Lian Xinruo.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.558
My dear cousin, are you sure?

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:19.069
I'm right here.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.549
How could I be mistaken?

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:24.639
The fishermen pulled
the remains from the river.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.798
The clothes on the body

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:29.989
and the bracelet on the wrist
prove it was Lian Xinruo.

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:32.199
It's just a pile of bones.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.838
If it wore your clothes

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.558
and your jewelry,

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:36.798
then it could be Lian Xinya too!

00:04:36.799 --> 00:04:37.719
You...

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.990
Du Youmeng.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.078
You really do have a sharp tongue.

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:46.199
But the police already
did an autopsy on the body.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.230
There is no doubt it was Lian Xinruo.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.879
Or do you, Miss Du,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.909
believe you're better
at solving cases than the police?

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:55.869
Uncle Pei is absolutely right.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.518
Du Youmeng,
you pretended to be my cousin

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:00.679
and now you want to seize
the Lian family's fortune.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.919
I'll have you taken

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.558
to the police station
for a hard lesson!

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:04.999
We'll see if you dare keep lying.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.719
That's right, you fraud.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.639
How dare you pretend to be Miss Xinruo?

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.239
Yes, send her to the police.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.278
See if she can lie again!

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.959
Exactly.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.350
I didn't lie.

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:15.229
Wait.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.230
What a lively scene.

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:20.278
I came just in time.

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:22.518
Second Brother, your timing is perfect.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:24.278
Du Youmeng is trying to commit fraud.

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:27.439
Xinya, as the victim,
wants to send her to the police.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.798
You're her husband.

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:30.598
Go with her.

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:31.549
Brother.

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.589
Isn't it a little too soon
to jump to conclusions?

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.309
Pei Yuze, what are you doing?

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:39.949
Allow me to introduce him.

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:44.518
This is my friend from abroad,
a forensic expert.

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:45.949
He is an authority in the field.

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:47.838
Since you can't agree,

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.669
why don't we all take a look together

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:52.118
and see if these remains
really belong to Lian Xinruo.

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:53.709
That coroner works for you.

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.879
Of course he'll say whatever you want.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.919
Whether it's true or not,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.510
you can always check for yourself.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.558
The victim suffered
blunt force trauma to the head.

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:11.038
The victim did not die from drowning.

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.309
The remains are indeed
of a girl about eighteen years old.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.109
We also found soil in the sternum.

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:18.558
Through testing,

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:19.949
we can confirm

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:23.278
the body was not in water for long.

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.869
It had been buried in the ground.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.798
And the head
had suffered severe trauma.

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:29.199
From this, we can conclude

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.990
the girl did not die from drowning.

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:36.278
Lian Xinya.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.078
You tried to fool everyone with a body

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:39.469
dug from the ground.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.598
Do you think the rest of us
are as stupid as you?

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:43.509
You...

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.150
A bunch of fools.

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.269
- Let's go.
- Let's leave.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.558
Yao, I need to go see Boss Lian.

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.078
Go home and take care
of some work for me.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:06.029
Yes, sir.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.479
Pei Yuze,
that friend of yours is amazing.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.639
Where did you meet him?

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.159
His background is very mysterious.
I can only tell you in secret.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.430
Tell me.

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.269
He is an actor.

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:31.919
That was too reckless!

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.318
What if they find out?

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:34.959
You're smart, and you didn't notice.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.350
How would they?

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.479
Thank you, boss.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.470
Remember to call me
next time you have a job.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.239
I just remembered

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.318
I have something to do.

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:55.549
Go back without me.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.999
Who told you to act on your own?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.159
Your sloppy little tricks ruined it!

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.350
Uncle Pei, I was wrong.
It's all my fault.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.479
I was too impatient.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.879
I got careless.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.318
But now everyone in the Lian family

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:17.399
is deceived by Du Youmeng.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.910
Nobody believes me.

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:20.549
If this keeps up,

00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:23.309
I'll lose my place
as head of the family.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.638
You've acted
without my permission again and again.

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:30.149
Do my words mean nothing to you?

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.230
Maybe I should find someone obedient
to lead the Lian family.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.750
No, please.

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:40.838
Uncle Pei, I was wrong.

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:42.349
I'm really sorry.

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:45.949
So now, does that mean
there is nothing else we can do?

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.358
That is not for you to worry about.

00:08:49.359 --> 00:08:50.949
I have my own plans.

00:08:58.319 --> 00:09:00.509
Brother, I'm here.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.519
(Shunyu Tailor Shop)

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.359
Sorry, miss.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.189
An investigation is ongoing.
Please leave.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.210

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.470
Du Youmeng.

00:10:01.719 --> 00:10:03.549
What are you really after?

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.349
Uncle, your medicine is ready.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.270
Uncle.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.670

Second Master!

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.949
Bad news, Second Master. Bad news!

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.550
Mr. Jiang, why are you here?

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.590
Me? I came to deliver medicine to Uncle.

00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:07.519
What happened?

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.519
On her way back,
Miss was caught in a gang shootout.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.950
We don't know if she's alive or dead.

00:11:24.319 --> 00:11:25.549
Who is it?

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.550
Perhaps the job is done?
