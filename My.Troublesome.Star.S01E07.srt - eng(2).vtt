[Characters, locales, organizations, religion,
and incidents in this drama are fictitious]

[Child actors were filmed safely and
under the guardian supervision]

00:00:44.497 --> 00:00:47.107
I'll make him come to me.

00:00:47.107 --> 00:00:49.017
Not only did he try to kill me,

00:00:49.017 --> 00:00:51.997
he ruined my life, too.

00:00:51.997 --> 00:00:55.367
I'll make sure to catch him myself.

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:59.477
He blatantly hurt Im Se Ra,
whom the whole country knows.

00:00:59.477 --> 00:01:01.887
What if that happens again?

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:05.667
- If it does-
- Right now,

00:01:06.997 --> 00:01:09.457
I'm not alone like I was then.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:18.317
What if I insist against signing Im Se Ra on?

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:23.967
I have no choice if the queen
of Two One Ent. opposes.

00:01:24.737 --> 00:01:26.597
But would you be okay, by the way?

00:01:26.597 --> 00:01:27.807
What do you mean?

00:01:27.807 --> 00:01:30.427
She's already a hit just one month
after she came back.

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:33.547
What would happen if it's revealed
that she's Im Se Ra?

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:41.967
Wouldn't you feel better if you kept her
close and watched her?

00:01:48.997 --> 00:01:51.187
What if I oppose it?

00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:54.777
You mean, you can't help me?

00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:56.077
I know it's dangerous.

00:01:56.077 --> 00:01:58.727
How could I watch you jumping into fire?

00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:02.267
You don't know if it'd be a fire
or another opportunity.

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:03.867
Anyway, I can't be on board.

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:05.987
You said you trust me.

00:02:05.987 --> 00:02:07.737
Just like I trust you.

00:02:07.737 --> 00:02:09.987
Can't you continue to have faith in me?

00:02:09.987 --> 00:02:13.037
What are you planning to do, exactly?

00:02:14.187 --> 00:02:17.287
He'll come back since he failed today.

00:02:18.257 --> 00:02:21.457
I'll face him instead of avoiding him.

00:02:21.457 --> 00:02:24.487
You'll continue to work while taking that risk?

00:02:24.487 --> 00:02:27.947
I've abandoned the name, Im Se Ra, and lived as if

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.697
I disappeared without a trace.

00:02:29.697 --> 00:02:31.387
I know. What if you continue to work

00:02:31.387 --> 00:02:33.967
and they find out you're Im Se Ra?

00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:36.697
No one knows what would happen then.

00:02:36.697 --> 00:02:39.987
What if I keep hiding because of that fear?

00:02:39.987 --> 00:02:42.147
I'll be giving them what they want.

00:02:42.147 --> 00:02:46.107
I-I'd be living as if I don't exist at all.

00:02:47.677 --> 00:02:51.637
I'll never live the way they want me to.

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:54.527
So, you insist on doing this?

00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:56.187
Yes.

00:02:56.187 --> 00:02:58.047
I don't worry, though.

00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:02.867
Because I have you by my side.

00:03:11.027 --> 00:03:13.257
You'll stay with me, right?

00:03:19.507 --> 00:03:20.917
Right?

00:03:25.957 --> 00:03:27.987
How can you laugh right now?

00:03:29.817 --> 00:03:33.137
Geez. Wow.

00:03:36.627 --> 00:03:38.757
Seriously.

00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:50.327
How can you laugh right now?

00:03:50.327 --> 00:03:52.737
Damn. Hey.
[Episode 7]

00:03:52.737 --> 00:03:55.067
Geez. You didn't have to give me this.

00:03:55.067 --> 00:04:00.127
Quietly, calmly, without causing trouble,
just for a year. Not even that long.

00:04:00.127 --> 00:04:03.167
I said to just stay at the traffic department.

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:08.067
I did. I tried to live like a corpse
without even breathing loudly...

00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:12.807
But it's not wrong for the traffic
department to deal with a car accident.

00:04:12.807 --> 00:04:15.597
The accident occurred at
Obong Intersection in Gangdong-gu.

00:04:15.597 --> 00:04:17.827
Why look into it in Gabong-ri, Chuncheon?

00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:22.167
And why arrest someone who attempted murder?

00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:25.587
Doing a good job is a problem now? Wow.

00:04:25.587 --> 00:04:27.877
The problem is that you made things worse.

00:04:27.877 --> 00:04:29.547
Move it.

00:04:35.537 --> 00:04:37.697
Is it about that old case?

00:04:46.157 --> 00:04:48.077
Sir,

00:04:48.077 --> 00:04:51.277
I finally found a connection between Ju Seung Pil

00:04:51.277 --> 00:04:53.367
and Two One Ent. after many years.

00:04:54.307 --> 00:04:56.047
I'm so close right now.

00:04:56.047 --> 00:04:59.027
Bong Cheong Ja and her offender hold the key.

00:04:59.027 --> 00:05:01.997
You said she has no memory whatsoever.

00:05:01.997 --> 00:05:05.617
So, give me just one chance. Please?

00:05:05.617 --> 00:05:09.197
I promise I'll bring you his head this time.

00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:16.087
I can't give you much time.

00:05:18.007 --> 00:05:19.687
Victory!

00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:36.267
Did your head explode after getting beaten? Huh?

00:05:36.267 --> 00:05:38.717
- What happened?
- What are you talking about?

00:05:38.717 --> 00:05:42.747
You shouldn't hum after getting
summoned by the Chief.

00:05:42.747 --> 00:05:44.797
This is serious.

00:05:52.627 --> 00:05:54.677
Yes, this is Dokgo Cheol.

00:05:55.677 --> 00:05:57.577
Yes.

00:05:57.577 --> 00:05:58.937
Next Wednesday?

00:05:58.937 --> 00:06:00.767
Yes. Just one second.

00:06:00.767 --> 00:06:03.107
Yes, that should work. Yes.

00:06:04.207 --> 00:06:06.227
A meeting with the director?

00:06:06.227 --> 00:06:07.527
Yes, yes, yes.

00:06:07.527 --> 00:06:10.767
Yes. What time and where should I meet you?

00:06:10.767 --> 00:06:12.577
Okay. I'll see you then.

00:06:12.577 --> 00:06:14.737
Yes. Thank you. Yes.

00:06:16.197 --> 00:06:18.877
Why don't you quit and switch jobs?

00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:21.887
I was going to request some time off, anyway.

00:06:21.887 --> 00:06:23.057
What?

00:06:23.057 --> 00:06:24.987
[Leave of absence request]
Once the shooting starts,

00:06:24.987 --> 00:06:27.287
she needs intensive care.

00:06:27.997 --> 00:06:31.107
Wow. Older fans are scary.

00:06:31.107 --> 00:06:35.037
Leave me and go to Bong Cheong Ja.

00:06:35.037 --> 00:06:42.257
All right, due to physical and mental
stress, Dokgo Cheol is requesting...

00:06:45.607 --> 00:06:46.727
Really?

00:06:46.727 --> 00:06:49.627
It's not even a big role. Are you that happy?

00:06:49.627 --> 00:06:51.397
Totally.

00:06:51.397 --> 00:06:55.237
Someone recognized my work and approached me.

00:06:56.737 --> 00:06:58.137
Hold on.

00:06:58.857 --> 00:07:01.227
Ahjussi, I'm getting off.

00:07:01.227 --> 00:07:03.017
Are you...

00:07:03.017 --> 00:07:04.677
Can you go there by bus?

00:07:04.677 --> 00:07:07.547
Of course. I need to save even a penny.

00:07:07.547 --> 00:07:10.207
It's a regular role, but it's small.

00:07:10.207 --> 00:07:11.997
I don't get paid that much.

00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:14.127
Anyway, thank you.

00:07:21.057 --> 00:07:22.857
Well...

00:07:23.987 --> 00:07:26.367
I need to tell you something.

00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:27.807
What is it?

00:07:27.807 --> 00:07:29.447
I'm...

00:07:31.507 --> 00:07:33.777
your daughter.

[Love Is Not a Crime]

00:07:36.907 --> 00:07:39.597
You're my daughter, Ahjumma?

00:07:39.597 --> 00:07:41.327
Dad.

00:07:43.327 --> 00:07:46.037
What happened to my daughter's face...

00:07:47.477 --> 00:07:50.887
You call that drama? Geez.

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.487
It's true.

00:07:52.487 --> 00:07:55.717
No matter how hard you try,

00:07:55.717 --> 00:07:59.077
that's exactly where you belong.

00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:02.957
You're Bong Cheong Ja, who does
a far-fetched daily soap opera.

00:08:04.607 --> 00:08:06.547
I...

00:08:07.877 --> 00:08:11.137
am not the old Go Hui Yeong.

00:08:11.137 --> 00:08:16.547
I'm not someone a nobody like you can mess with!

00:08:30.657 --> 00:08:32.757
Yay!

00:08:36.227 --> 00:08:37.447
Thank you.

00:08:37.447 --> 00:08:40.237
You came to congratulate me
on finishing the script.

00:08:40.237 --> 00:08:42.827
It's not much of a party, is it?

00:08:42.827 --> 00:08:45.447
Compared to when I couldn't even eat
because of gastritis when I was writing,

00:08:45.447 --> 00:08:47.837
this is such a feast.

00:08:50.087 --> 00:08:52.557
My sister made these dumplings.

00:08:53.167 --> 00:08:54.647
Try some.

00:08:54.647 --> 00:08:58.717
She runs a dumpling shop. She's amazing.

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:04.227
You looked like a good cook, too.

00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:05.817
It must be a family trait.

00:09:05.817 --> 00:09:09.607
Is your family also good at writing, then?

00:09:10.367 --> 00:09:12.737
My parents strongly opposed my becoming a writer.

00:09:12.737 --> 00:09:15.657
But I insisted and became one.

00:09:15.657 --> 00:09:17.067
But look at me now.

00:09:17.067 --> 00:09:19.077
Gosh, Ms. Chu.

00:09:19.077 --> 00:09:21.937
Your work is the top daily drama.

00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:23.607
Don't say that.

00:09:23.607 --> 00:09:28.117
My dream was to write an American-style thriller.

00:09:29.047 --> 00:09:34.287
I'm sure playing a housekeeper in a daily
drama wasn't your dream, either.

This looks like a script. What is it?

00:09:51.267 --> 00:09:55.867
It's my first project I worked on
after winning a competition.

00:09:55.867 --> 00:10:00.127
I got rejected because it was
too dark and depressing.

00:10:00.127 --> 00:10:03.727
Excuse me. I'll bring more alcohol.

Ms. Chu,

00:10:27.757 --> 00:10:29.367
this is so engaging.

00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:31.497
It would've been accepted if it were.

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:33.957
Both the actors and broadcasting
companies rejected.

00:10:33.957 --> 00:10:36.767
It wouldn't have been rejected by everyone.

00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:40.607
Do you mind if I read this at home?

00:10:45.307 --> 00:10:51.007
Bus No. 765 will be arriving shortly.

00:11:04.417 --> 00:11:06.497
Yes, this is Bong Cheong Ja...

Right now?

Have a seat.

00:11:19.927 --> 00:11:21.677
I'll have the usual.

00:11:21.677 --> 00:11:23.487
No.

00:11:23.487 --> 00:11:25.707
Since I brought someone special today,

00:11:25.707 --> 00:11:27.647
bring us the most expensive one.

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:30.497
Here.

Straight.

00:11:45.147 --> 00:11:46.827
Okay.

Sign a contract with me.

00:11:53.957 --> 00:11:58.417
Did you send the coffee truck to the set for this?

00:11:58.417 --> 00:12:03.777
Noona, a lot of actors are
desperate to join Two One.

00:12:03.777 --> 00:12:06.767
And actors at your level just can't.

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:10.247
It's a company they can only dream of.

00:12:10.247 --> 00:12:13.007
- My level?
- Yes.

00:12:13.007 --> 00:12:14.807
That's even weirder.

What would you do with someone at my level?

00:12:17.207 --> 00:12:19.507

Do you need Bong Cheong Ja or Im Se Ra?

00:12:34.207 --> 00:12:37.147
Whenever he's put on the spot,

00:12:37.147 --> 00:12:40.187
he wets his lips and speaks with an accent.

00:12:40.877 --> 00:12:42.477
Both?

00:12:53.007 --> 00:12:55.587

00:13:19.877 --> 00:13:23.757
Who was that man?

00:13:24.617 --> 00:13:26.757
Why are you curious about that now?

00:13:26.757 --> 00:13:28.667
I asked a question.

00:13:28.667 --> 00:13:30.207
Answer me.

00:13:31.127 --> 00:13:32.547
Finding out won't do you any good.

00:13:32.547 --> 00:13:34.597
I'll be the judge of that.

00:13:35.267 --> 00:13:37.037
Must you know?

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:44.627
He must be someone important
since you keep dragging, huh?

00:13:47.007 --> 00:13:48.587
Tell me.

00:13:50.137 --> 00:13:53.877
It's because telling you won't do anything.

00:13:53.877 --> 00:13:55.557
What do you mean by that?

00:13:55.557 --> 00:13:59.907
He's already crossed the Jordan River.

00:14:01.557 --> 00:14:03.657
He's already dead, I mean.

00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:26.497
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

00:14:26.497 --> 00:14:28.127
About what we discussed earlier.

00:14:28.127 --> 00:14:30.167
I don't know how much your manager paid,

00:14:30.167 --> 00:14:32.427
but we can easily cover the contract penalty.

00:14:32.427 --> 00:14:34.947
I think I already gave you my answer.

00:14:35.997 --> 00:14:38.667
Even if I pay you double?

00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:41.737
Call me if you'll meet my contract requirement.

00:14:41.737 --> 00:14:44.597
I'm not willing to compromise more.

00:14:44.597 --> 00:14:46.127
I'm leaving.

00:14:48.837 --> 00:14:51.277
I only have one contract requirement.

00:14:51.277 --> 00:14:54.097
To join your company with my manager.

00:14:54.097 --> 00:14:57.457
Do you really need to bring him to Two One?

00:14:57.457 --> 00:15:02.047
Yes. He's as important as my life.

00:15:02.047 --> 00:15:05.897
By chance, are you two...

00:15:05.897 --> 00:15:07.617
No, right?

00:15:09.987 --> 00:15:11.747
Geez...

00:15:44.017 --> 00:15:46.407
He's dead already?

00:15:57.487 --> 00:15:59.157
[Do Ik Hwan]

00:15:59.157 --> 00:16:01.337
[Do Ik Hwan - Assemblyman]

00:16:01.337 --> 00:16:07.827
[Former assemblyman,
Do Ik Hwan, died from illness]

00:16:29.927 --> 00:16:32.577
Why did you kidnap Ms. Bong Cheong Ja?

00:16:36.507 --> 00:16:39.967
You purchased a drug online to use for kidnapping.

00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:43.447
You even put down a plastic sheet
at the kidnapping site.

00:16:43.447 --> 00:16:47.217
You planned to discard the body after killing her.

00:16:47.217 --> 00:16:50.737
A month ago, you feigned falling asleep
behind the wheel and struck her.

00:16:50.737 --> 00:16:52.947
Were you planning to kill her then?

00:16:56.257 --> 00:16:59.457
Mr. Kang Dae Gu, you're
an attempted murder suspect.

00:16:59.457 --> 00:17:01.587
You attempted twice, not just once.

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:03.657
You kidnapped her and tried
to kill her with a weapon.

00:17:03.657 --> 00:17:06.277
Your intent was already proven.

00:17:06.277 --> 00:17:10.217
You can serve at least 10 to 20 years in jail!

00:17:16.297 --> 00:17:19.867
I'm from the Law Firm Park and Kwon.

00:17:19.867 --> 00:17:23.777
As Mr. Kang's attorney,
I'll attend the questioning.

00:17:23.777 --> 00:17:25.647
All of you want to be here?

00:17:25.647 --> 00:17:28.737
I already got approval from your higher-up.

00:17:31.527 --> 00:17:33.387
Talk to me for a second.

00:17:41.647 --> 00:17:43.857
Can I get out now?

00:17:43.857 --> 00:17:47.957
That would be up to you, Mr. Kang.

00:17:47.957 --> 00:17:49.827
What the hell...

00:17:54.057 --> 00:17:56.737
Watch your mouth if you want to get out.

00:17:59.027 --> 00:18:00.237
Okay.

00:18:00.237 --> 00:18:01.867
Okay.

00:18:08.457 --> 00:18:12.487
A truck driver can't afford this legal team.

00:18:17.057 --> 00:18:19.367
Is it you again, Ju Seung Pil?

00:18:23.427 --> 00:18:26.597
The name is Kim Ji Ah. She was born in 2003.

00:18:26.597 --> 00:18:29.417
Her specialties are singing and dancing.

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:33.207
Yes, Mr. Ban.

00:18:33.207 --> 00:18:35.197
Have you read the script I sent you?

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:37.097
Yes. I liked it.

00:18:37.097 --> 00:18:38.647
I know.

00:18:38.647 --> 00:18:40.207
As soon as I read the script,

00:18:40.207 --> 00:18:43.207
I knew Mr. Won had to be the male lead.

00:18:43.207 --> 00:18:45.857
He can act. He's handsome.

00:18:45.857 --> 00:18:47.987
The programming is perfectly set up.

00:18:47.987 --> 00:18:51.907
He's considering it with an open mind, too. But...

00:18:51.907 --> 00:18:54.547
Is there some sort of an issue?

00:18:54.547 --> 00:18:55.987
As you've mentioned before,

00:18:55.987 --> 00:18:59.587
this definitely will be
Im Se Ra's comeback, right?

00:18:59.587 --> 00:19:01.227
Come on, Mr. Ban.

00:19:01.227 --> 00:19:03.837
Just make sure Mr. Won doesn't go anywhere.

00:19:03.837 --> 00:19:07.047
We'll prepare everything and come pick him up.

00:19:07.047 --> 00:19:08.457
Okay?

00:19:09.467 --> 00:19:11.327
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:19:11.327 --> 00:19:13.357
Congratulations on selling out.

00:19:13.357 --> 00:19:15.927
Thank you. It's all thanks to you, Unni.

00:19:15.927 --> 00:19:18.067
I redeemed myself after
being humiliated by Shably.

00:19:18.067 --> 00:19:20.827
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:23.417
Why do you and Shably hate each other?

00:19:23.417 --> 00:19:24.657
You used to be a team.

00:19:24.657 --> 00:19:27.497
How many times did I tell you?

00:19:27.497 --> 00:19:30.687
She's always been provoking me
since way back when.

00:19:30.687 --> 00:19:32.807
She called me a low-born and whatnot.

00:19:32.807 --> 00:19:34.067
That terrible girl.

00:19:34.067 --> 00:19:37.967
Seon Yeong suffered a lot since she joined
the industry as a high schooler.

00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:41.367
That makes her the real deal,
and I had connections.

00:19:41.367 --> 00:19:43.407
And if we were a team,

00:19:43.407 --> 00:19:45.717
she should've stayed loyal.

00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:49.887
As soon as you got into the accident, she
sided with Go Hui Yeong immediately. I hate her.

00:19:49.887 --> 00:19:53.057
They could've teamed up before that.

00:19:57.177 --> 00:20:00.687
You were at Im Se Ra's place during the accident,

00:20:00.687 --> 00:20:02.507
but where was Shably?

00:20:02.507 --> 00:20:04.947
I was so out of it then.

00:20:04.947 --> 00:20:08.247
Gosh, thinking now, I don't think
I saw her at the hospital.

00:20:08.247 --> 00:20:09.407
Is that so?

00:20:09.407 --> 00:20:12.977
She left as if she knew you'd be in an accident.

00:20:12.977 --> 00:20:17.087
Gosh. She must've been in Kang Du Won's car.

00:20:17.087 --> 00:20:18.747
Something happened in the car, then.

00:20:18.747 --> 00:20:21.517
They must've said, "Im Se Ra is coming to an end.

00:20:21.517 --> 00:20:22.767
Work with Go Hui Yeong.

00:20:22.767 --> 00:20:25.097
Forget about the setting sun
and focus on the future."

00:20:25.097 --> 00:20:28.557
Watch your mouth. Don't say stuff like that.

00:20:28.557 --> 00:20:33.837
What if they knew about the accident in advance?

00:20:33.837 --> 00:20:37.187
Does that make them accomplices?

00:20:37.187 --> 00:20:39.137
What do you mean?

00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:42.777
Are you saying the accident wasn't an accident?

00:20:44.127 --> 00:20:47.317
I'm just saying it's a possibility.

00:20:47.317 --> 00:20:50.367
You think like a far-fetched soap
opera since you're in one.

00:20:50.367 --> 00:20:53.247
What psycho would cause a car accident?
What for? A murder?

00:20:53.247 --> 00:20:54.657
I know.

00:20:54.657 --> 00:20:57.527
I did come back from death then.

00:21:05.217 --> 00:21:07.207
[Dawon Inn]

00:21:24.087 --> 00:21:29.127
There's a bag he left behind before leaving.

00:21:29.127 --> 00:21:30.687
A bag?

00:21:32.137 --> 00:21:33.967
I did look inside.

00:21:33.967 --> 00:21:36.387
There were only clothes.

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:19.987
Geez. I'm sleepy.

00:22:19.987 --> 00:22:22.627
Why do you keep bothering me?

00:22:23.517 --> 00:22:26.237
Yes, it's me.

00:22:26.237 --> 00:22:28.077
Yes.

00:22:31.527 --> 00:22:34.547
What is it? Because I keep refusing to speak,

00:22:34.547 --> 00:22:37.067
you switched players or something?

00:22:37.067 --> 00:22:38.907
It's not going to work.

00:22:38.907 --> 00:22:42.267
I won't speak without my attorneys.

00:22:42.267 --> 00:22:46.357
I don't want to hear your voice, either.
Just shut your mouth and listen.

00:22:46.357 --> 00:22:48.927
I just came back from somewhere.

00:22:48.927 --> 00:22:51.087
Where you used to hide.

00:22:52.827 --> 00:22:58.077
No matter how hard you look,
you won't find anything there.

00:23:01.327 --> 00:23:03.837
Gosh, I know.

00:23:03.837 --> 00:23:05.957
There wasn't much.

00:23:07.057 --> 00:23:10.577
I thought it was a bust and was about to leave,

00:23:11.667 --> 00:23:17.097
but the inn owner brought me a bag. You know?

00:23:17.097 --> 00:23:19.967
But there wasn't much in there, either.

00:23:19.967 --> 00:23:22.747
You can imagine how disappointed I was, right?

00:23:22.747 --> 00:23:24.447
Geez.

00:23:24.447 --> 00:23:28.197
I even craved a cigarette
that I quit a long time ago.

00:23:49.947 --> 00:23:51.847
How did you even find this?

00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:53.907
Open the latest file.

00:23:56.687 --> 00:23:59.627
I risked my life when I did that, too.

00:23:59.627 --> 00:24:02.547
That ahjumma just won't die. What am I to do?

00:24:02.547 --> 00:24:03.847
Keep listening.

00:24:03.847 --> 00:24:05.917
An annoying bastard is after us.

00:24:05.917 --> 00:24:08.267
It's better than going back to jail, right?

00:24:08.267 --> 00:24:09.337
Five times more.

00:24:09.337 --> 00:24:11.747
- No, no. Pay me ten times more.
- I'll pay you.

00:24:11.747 --> 00:24:15.877
- Really?
- But do it right this time. Got it?

00:24:15.877 --> 00:24:19.047
Could it be the same ahjumma? Again?

00:24:27.357 --> 00:24:29.047
What?

00:24:29.047 --> 00:24:30.987
Do you have something to say?

00:24:31.857 --> 00:24:33.607
Say it if you do.

00:24:34.667 --> 00:24:40.067
As in who you met at Gayeon Hotel.

00:24:44.587 --> 00:24:47.077
Geez. You don't even pay me that much.

00:24:47.077 --> 00:24:49.567
Why do you keep bothering me?

00:24:49.567 --> 00:24:51.437
Let's not make this troublesome for us.

00:24:51.437 --> 00:24:53.717
You think I was secretly recording?

00:24:53.717 --> 00:24:55.247
Geez.

00:24:55.247 --> 00:24:58.597
You think I have no work ethic
because I do stuff like this?

00:25:04.157 --> 00:25:06.297
What?

00:25:06.297 --> 00:25:08.627
Will you steal my last cigarette now?

00:25:13.577 --> 00:25:17.407
Hey, did you have to bring him to me?

00:25:17.407 --> 00:25:19.157
You should've taken care of it.

00:25:19.157 --> 00:25:21.237
It's a very important matter.

00:25:24.297 --> 00:25:27.567
So, what's his job?

00:25:27.567 --> 00:25:31.597
Well, I was told to take care of an ahjumma.

00:25:37.387 --> 00:25:39.667
Take your hands out of your pockets.

00:25:44.267 --> 00:25:49.167
So, how will you take care of her? Huh?

00:25:49.167 --> 00:25:51.767
Well, probably one or the other.

00:25:51.767 --> 00:25:56.067
I'll either kill her or turn her into a cripple.

00:25:59.957 --> 00:26:05.007
Well, those options have different prices.

00:26:11.667 --> 00:26:16.367
Whether you kill her or put her
into a coma, I don't care.

00:26:16.367 --> 00:26:18.627
What's important is that...

00:26:18.627 --> 00:26:21.337
Yes. Of course. I'll keep this shut.

00:26:21.337 --> 00:26:24.067
The fact that you're meeting me
means one thing or the other.

00:26:24.067 --> 00:26:28.167
Either you did a fantastic job that
I'll never have to see you again.

00:26:28.167 --> 00:26:33.367
Or you messed up slightly,
and I'll never see you again.

00:26:40.687 --> 00:26:42.247
Did you laugh?

00:26:48.867 --> 00:26:51.967
Hotel? What hotel? I don't know about that.

00:26:51.967 --> 00:26:55.307
You know, not the one who gave
you the job. His boss.

00:26:55.307 --> 00:26:56.367
You really don't know?

00:26:56.367 --> 00:26:58.807
I don't. I don't. How many times
do you have to ask?

00:26:58.807 --> 00:27:02.307
You scared me. Fine, you don't. Why scream?

00:27:02.307 --> 00:27:04.147
Okay, okay.

00:27:04.147 --> 00:27:07.227
I'll ask Gwak Jeong Do if you don't.

00:27:07.227 --> 00:27:09.677
Why? Why? What for?

00:27:09.677 --> 00:27:13.527
Wait, what will you ask him?

00:27:15.927 --> 00:27:18.747
I'll ask whose voice this is.

00:27:18.747 --> 00:27:21.147
He must know since he was there.

00:27:23.547 --> 00:27:28.307
Well, how did you know that was Gwak Jeong Do?

00:27:30.027 --> 00:27:32.767
The other one was definitely Gwak Jeong Do, huh?

00:27:32.767 --> 00:27:35.537
Your eyes shook just now. Yes.

00:27:37.467 --> 00:27:39.357
I... I didn't say anything.

00:27:39.357 --> 00:27:41.667
I'll exercise my right to be silent now.
Don't ask me anything.

00:27:41.667 --> 00:27:45.217
What would happen if I played
this audio for Gwak Jeong Do?

00:27:45.217 --> 00:27:49.437
No, no. It'd be better to say
you gave it to me. Right?

00:27:49.437 --> 00:27:51.347
You bastard!

00:27:52.447 --> 00:27:55.907
Kang Dae Gu, listen carefully.

00:27:55.907 --> 00:27:58.077
You know better than me

00:27:58.077 --> 00:28:01.907
how thorough they are when
it comes to killing someone.

00:28:01.907 --> 00:28:04.107
Killing you?

00:28:04.107 --> 00:28:06.307
It's probably nothing to them.

00:28:37.147 --> 00:28:38.767
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:28:38.767 --> 00:28:40.387
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:28:40.387 --> 00:28:43.327
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:28:43.327 --> 00:28:45.197
Just one second.

00:28:46.507 --> 00:28:48.817
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:28:50.277 --> 00:28:52.427
What's Aunt doing here?

00:28:56.237 --> 00:28:58.947
Here. Let's sign the contract.

00:29:04.107 --> 00:29:06.127
Are you meeting my requirement?

00:29:06.127 --> 00:29:09.897
I am. I'm doubling the contract fee as I said.

00:29:18.007 --> 00:29:19.847
Hold on, Noona.

00:29:23.077 --> 00:29:24.427
Take this with you.

00:29:24.427 --> 00:29:25.927
Huh? There it was.
[Miscasting]

00:29:25.927 --> 00:29:27.217
I looked for it everywhere.

00:29:27.217 --> 00:29:29.367
I love stories like that.

00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:33.067
A nobody side character surviving
until the end, carrying the story,

00:29:33.067 --> 00:29:34.987
and defeating all the lead characters.

00:29:34.987 --> 00:29:36.127
Did you read it?

00:29:36.127 --> 00:29:38.777
Im Sun sure is a powerful character.

00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:42.557
You said my only good quality
was being light on my feet.

00:29:42.557 --> 00:29:44.737
But I have good taste in scripts.

00:29:44.737 --> 00:29:47.307
I recommended you "Jewelry Shop Girl," too.

00:29:47.307 --> 00:29:50.927
Yes. You must be where you are for that reason.

00:29:50.927 --> 00:29:53.127
What I meant is-

00:29:53.127 --> 00:29:55.297
Let's stop talking about the past.

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:58.197
Noona,

00:29:58.197 --> 00:30:00.327
look over there.

00:30:00.327 --> 00:30:03.687
Let's only look forward from now on.

00:30:13.627 --> 00:30:16.237
Wow. A contract for me?

00:30:16.237 --> 00:30:19.317
Am I really joining Two One with you?

00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:20.807
I'm telling you.

00:30:20.807 --> 00:30:23.937
Okay. Sounds good. As a manager, I mean,

00:30:23.937 --> 00:30:27.767
as your true manager, I'll make sure to help you.

00:30:27.767 --> 00:30:32.667
What would help me is to catch
that son of a bitch who tried to kill-

00:30:33.947 --> 00:30:36.717
It's to catch him.

00:30:36.717 --> 00:30:38.967
Let's continue our phone conversation.

00:30:38.967 --> 00:30:43.637
The man you met 25 years ago was
the late Assemblyman Do Ik Hwan?

00:30:43.637 --> 00:30:47.497
I thought it was him because
he was wearing the same watch.

00:30:47.497 --> 00:30:49.727
But no.

00:30:49.727 --> 00:30:51.617
Do Ik Hwan.

00:30:52.607 --> 00:30:54.567
Let's dig around him first.

00:30:54.567 --> 00:30:57.577
There must be a connection somewhere.

00:30:57.577 --> 00:30:59.297
Don't worry. I'll catch him soon.

00:30:59.297 --> 00:31:01.647
Did you find anything?

00:31:01.647 --> 00:31:06.687
I think I found conclusive evidence
that would force him to speak.

00:31:12.487 --> 00:31:14.367
What?

00:31:14.367 --> 00:31:19.767
The real culprit might be one
of the people I know.

00:31:21.117 --> 00:31:23.557
I thought you were ready to face that.

00:31:24.927 --> 00:31:29.397
It's not like I have the memory of those 25 years.

00:31:29.397 --> 00:31:31.917
Right now,

00:31:31.917 --> 00:31:37.397
I feel attached and miss everyone around me.

00:31:38.277 --> 00:31:43.697
The fact that they suddenly changed feels strange.

00:31:43.697 --> 00:31:47.317
It might be better that you lost your memory.

00:31:47.317 --> 00:31:50.247
You can judge things more clearly.

00:31:50.247 --> 00:31:55.107
People usually try to ignore hard truths.

00:31:59.037 --> 00:32:00.937
Right.

00:32:00.937 --> 00:32:02.407
Here.

00:32:05.477 --> 00:32:07.347
What's this?

00:32:09.007 --> 00:32:10.987
Is it a gift?

00:32:24.087 --> 00:32:26.707
Carry it around just in case.

00:32:32.627 --> 00:32:33.787
Oh, no!

00:32:33.787 --> 00:32:35.467
What? Gosh.

00:32:35.467 --> 00:32:37.167
How does this work? Why won't it work?

00:32:37.167 --> 00:32:39.327
Hurry. Hurry. Gosh.

00:32:40.527 --> 00:32:42.457
I'm sorry.

00:32:42.457 --> 00:32:43.627
Here. Take a look.

00:32:43.627 --> 00:32:45.857
You see the safety pin here?

00:32:45.857 --> 00:32:47.397
You always raise this and-

00:32:47.397 --> 00:32:49.077
Don't bother.

00:32:49.077 --> 00:32:50.867
I can just look it up on YouTube.

00:32:50.867 --> 00:32:54.937
And I put a whistle on a chain. Always keep it on.

00:32:54.937 --> 00:32:56.397
Gosh, fine.

00:32:56.397 --> 00:32:58.267
Make sure to wear it, okay?

00:32:58.267 --> 00:33:02.767
It's not even a gold necklace
or a silver necklace.

00:33:02.767 --> 00:33:05.457
A whistle and a gas gun.

00:33:07.397 --> 00:33:10.377
And let's share each other's location, too.

00:33:10.377 --> 00:33:11.447
Why would we do that?

00:33:11.447 --> 00:33:14.087
W-What are we, a couple or something?

00:33:14.087 --> 00:33:15.567
You've been kidnapped recently.

00:33:15.567 --> 00:33:17.537
Just in case. Come on.

00:33:17.537 --> 00:33:18.867
It's okay.

00:33:18.867 --> 00:33:22.547
I'll press No. 1 and call you
if something happens. Don't worry.

00:33:22.547 --> 00:33:24.557
Don't be stubborn. Hurry-

00:33:26.047 --> 00:33:27.777
Hold on.

00:33:27.777 --> 00:33:30.907
My speed dial is No. 1?

00:33:36.867 --> 00:33:39.267
- Who says?
- You just said No. 1.

00:33:39.267 --> 00:33:42.267
- You said you'll press No. 1.
- No.

00:33:42.267 --> 00:33:44.167
No. 121.

00:33:44.167 --> 00:33:48.527
- I definitely said No. 121.
- I see.

00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:51.167
No. 121? Okay.

00:33:51.167 --> 00:33:54.477
I'll still save you as No. 1.

00:33:55.447 --> 00:33:57.407
Do whatever you want.

00:34:02.887 --> 00:34:04.987
[Bong Cheong Ja signed
with Two One Entertainment]

00:34:04.987 --> 00:34:07.697
He ended up signing with her.

00:34:07.697 --> 00:34:11.697
It turns out she's so below Two One's standard,

00:34:11.697 --> 00:34:13.607
she signed under terrible terms.

00:34:13.607 --> 00:34:16.997
She was paid double, as far as I know.

00:34:16.997 --> 00:34:20.077
But the contract signing fee was so small already.

00:34:20.077 --> 00:34:22.627
Why do you keep tiptoeing around me?

00:34:22.627 --> 00:34:27.207
As if I was against signing her on.

00:34:29.917 --> 00:34:32.867
She's just a minor role actor. Don't be silly.

00:34:32.867 --> 00:34:35.567
I should give her a welcome gift.

00:34:35.567 --> 00:34:37.507
Gift?

00:34:37.507 --> 00:34:41.777
The latest commercial proposal
sounds perfect for her.

00:34:46.087 --> 00:34:48.297
A commercial?

00:34:51.587 --> 00:34:54.077
I didn't even imagine doing a commercial.

00:34:54.077 --> 00:34:58.157
Are you sure it's for me?

00:34:58.157 --> 00:35:00.727
Yes. Until the shoot day,

00:35:00.727 --> 00:35:03.617
I'll be on a diet and do skincare-

00:35:04.777 --> 00:35:09.007
You don't want me to go on a diet?

00:35:09.007 --> 00:35:10.327
Okay, then.

00:35:10.327 --> 00:35:13.527
Thank you so much. Okay.

00:35:15.017 --> 00:35:16.677
You already have a manager?

00:35:16.677 --> 00:35:18.217
Yes.

00:35:18.217 --> 00:35:22.377
And I'm shooting a commercial.

00:35:23.487 --> 00:35:25.797
Wasn't it voice phishing?

00:35:26.677 --> 00:35:30.127
It's a proper commercial deal I got officially.

00:35:31.077 --> 00:35:32.747
You have so much stuff.

00:35:32.747 --> 00:35:33.847
There isn't.

00:35:33.847 --> 00:35:35.247
Let's go.

00:35:36.317 --> 00:35:38.297
Dad,

00:35:38.297 --> 00:35:40.447
I'm here.

00:35:40.447 --> 00:35:42.987
Your eldest daughter.

00:35:48.917 --> 00:35:50.657
Im Se Ra.

00:35:50.657 --> 00:35:55.867
Aigoo. I said there's no point telling him.

00:35:59.947 --> 00:36:01.637
Se Ra.

00:36:03.237 --> 00:36:05.137
Huh? Dad.

00:36:05.137 --> 00:36:07.617
Dad, do you remember me?

00:36:07.617 --> 00:36:12.067
Dad, yes. It's me, Se Ra. Your daughter.

00:36:12.067 --> 00:36:14.267
You're Se Ra?

00:36:14.267 --> 00:36:15.767
Yes...

00:36:19.097 --> 00:36:21.817
- Se Ra.
- Dad.

00:36:21.817 --> 00:36:23.777
My dad.

00:36:24.777 --> 00:36:27.507
When did you age so much?

00:36:28.467 --> 00:36:30.787
My pretty Se Ra.

00:36:30.787 --> 00:36:33.007
You haven't changed.

00:36:33.887 --> 00:36:37.537
You haven't changed. Aigoo...

00:36:42.247 --> 00:36:44.447
No, Dad.

00:36:45.657 --> 00:36:48.307
I've changed.

00:36:48.307 --> 00:36:50.787
I changed a lot, too.

00:36:52.857 --> 00:36:55.137
No.

00:36:55.137 --> 00:36:58.927
You're the prettiest one.

00:36:58.927 --> 00:37:04.787
You're the prettiest one on TV, Se Ra.

00:37:38.367 --> 00:37:42.367
Hey, Noona. Are you that excited
about getting paid for the commercial?

00:37:42.367 --> 00:37:47.047
I mean, you should've told me
about the storyboard.

00:37:48.337 --> 00:37:50.637
You tricked me on purpose, didn't you?

00:37:50.637 --> 00:37:52.247
What are you talking about?

00:37:52.247 --> 00:37:55.177
It was delayed because the
storyboard kept changing.

00:37:55.177 --> 00:37:57.657
But you got paid quickly. What's the problem?

00:37:57.657 --> 00:37:59.677
You think there's no problem?

00:38:01.167 --> 00:38:03.247
Let's talk later.

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:05.327
Is there an issue?

00:38:05.327 --> 00:38:06.997
No.

00:38:06.997 --> 00:38:09.057
I got the costume.

00:38:09.057 --> 00:38:11.197
It's a bit flashy, though.

00:38:15.997 --> 00:38:19.367
Could you be outside when I shoot?

00:38:19.367 --> 00:38:22.267
What do you mean? I'm your manager.
I need to stick with you.

00:38:22.267 --> 00:38:26.707
Well, I haven't done a commercial in a while.

00:38:26.707 --> 00:38:30.567
I'd be too nervous. You can wait outside.

00:38:30.567 --> 00:38:32.367
I knew you'd say that. Ta-da.

00:38:32.367 --> 00:38:36.667
The company managers said I should
take extra care for commercial shoots.

00:38:36.667 --> 00:38:38.257
Isn't that a great tip?

00:38:39.187 --> 00:38:41.487
Ms. Go Hui Yeong is here.

00:38:43.567 --> 00:38:45.167
Go Hui Yeong?

00:38:47.477 --> 00:38:51.197
Is she the one who's shooting with me today?

00:38:51.197 --> 00:38:53.757
I haven't heard that, either.

00:38:53.757 --> 00:38:55.257
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:38:55.257 --> 00:38:56.787
Ms. Go, you came.

00:38:56.787 --> 00:39:01.357
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:39:19.627 --> 00:39:21.917
- Hello, Director.
- Hey.

00:39:21.917 --> 00:39:23.297
I'm late, aren't I?

00:39:23.297 --> 00:39:27.507
The main event always happens last.

00:39:27.507 --> 00:39:29.317
I thought the storyboard was fun.

00:39:29.317 --> 00:39:33.757
Skit-style commercials are trendy these days.

00:39:33.757 --> 00:39:36.937
Hey, over there. Come here.

00:39:40.557 --> 00:39:42.747
M-Me?

00:39:42.747 --> 00:39:44.137
Yes.

00:39:51.667 --> 00:39:53.207
You know each other, right?

00:39:53.207 --> 00:39:56.017
She was recommended by Ms. Go's agency.

00:39:57.087 --> 00:40:01.737
Well, I don't know her.

00:40:01.737 --> 00:40:06.857
By chance, will she be my partner today?

00:40:06.857 --> 00:40:09.167
Yes.

00:40:13.317 --> 00:40:15.477
I look forward to working with you.

00:40:16.377 --> 00:40:18.667
Is she out of her mind?

00:40:18.667 --> 00:40:22.627
I know she'd be standing next to me
like a shadow. But still.

00:40:22.627 --> 00:40:27.207
How could I shoot a commercial
with an ahjumma like this?

00:40:28.087 --> 00:40:30.627
You've got to be kidding me.

00:40:30.627 --> 00:40:31.807
Move.

00:40:31.807 --> 00:40:34.117
- Noona, you can't suddenly do this.
- Wait...

00:40:34.117 --> 00:40:37.197
Where are you going, Noona? Noona.

00:40:39.157 --> 00:40:41.307
You follow her.

00:40:42.707 --> 00:40:43.777
Why should I?

00:40:43.777 --> 00:40:46.507
Ms. Go is upset because of you.

00:40:46.507 --> 00:40:49.277
Geez. I thought your agency told you.

00:40:49.277 --> 00:40:51.457
Will you get the shoot canceled? Huh?

00:40:51.457 --> 00:40:54.487
Why would you yell at her?

00:40:54.487 --> 00:40:56.637
W-What's with you?

00:40:57.737 --> 00:41:00.837
I'll follow her.

00:41:07.377 --> 00:41:09.907
Huh? Baek Ja.

00:41:09.907 --> 00:41:12.587
You said you were shooting a commercial today.

00:41:12.587 --> 00:41:15.277
So, I brought this for everyone.

00:41:20.537 --> 00:41:22.497
I shouldn't have come.

00:41:22.497 --> 00:41:24.467
I didn't know. I'd be in the way.

00:41:24.467 --> 00:41:28.657
- I'll just leave this here and go.
- N-No, give that to me.

00:41:29.747 --> 00:41:32.507
Wait, okay? You have to wait.

00:41:38.957 --> 00:41:41.107
Hold on!

00:41:41.107 --> 00:41:43.937
Hold on, Ms. Go! Hold on.

00:41:43.937 --> 00:41:45.817
Hold on, Ms. Go.

00:41:46.727 --> 00:41:48.627
You can't leave like this.

00:41:48.627 --> 00:41:52.907
Doesn't make sense to cancel
the shoot because of me.

00:41:54.167 --> 00:41:58.657
Whether it makes sense or not,
it's none of your business.

00:41:58.657 --> 00:42:02.337
But still. You can't leave like this.

00:42:02.337 --> 00:42:06.527
What would happen to everyone else here?

00:42:06.527 --> 00:42:10.187
Do you really not know why I'm doing this?

00:42:17.147 --> 00:42:20.987
Tell me what the problem is.

00:42:20.987 --> 00:42:23.937
Get yourself a commercial deal on your own

00:42:23.937 --> 00:42:28.517
if you want it instead of relying on me.

00:42:28.517 --> 00:42:32.067
Don't try to piggyback on me.

00:42:36.917 --> 00:42:38.227
Unni.

00:42:38.227 --> 00:42:40.037
Unni, you know this is my first commercial.

00:42:40.037 --> 00:42:42.177
But you're leaving like this? Really?

00:42:42.177 --> 00:42:44.537
You aren't actually leaving, right?

00:42:44.537 --> 00:42:46.817
Get yourself a commercial deal if you want it.

00:42:46.817 --> 00:42:49.217
Don't try to piggyback on me.

00:42:53.317 --> 00:42:54.887
You...

00:42:56.087 --> 00:42:58.617
You knew.

00:42:59.967 --> 00:43:04.067
- You're doing this on purpose-
- I have no idea what you mean.

00:43:08.207 --> 00:43:10.067
I see you're trying to screw me.

00:43:10.067 --> 00:43:13.047
I do, but first...

00:43:13.047 --> 00:43:14.667
Let's shoot first and...

00:43:14.667 --> 00:43:16.027
Aren't we leaving?

00:43:16.027 --> 00:43:17.317
Hold on.

00:43:17.317 --> 00:43:20.057
Hold on. Hold on, please.

00:43:20.057 --> 00:43:23.387
What? Will you kneel or something?

00:43:25.317 --> 00:43:28.007
You're acting cocky because
you got a bit famous.

00:43:28.007 --> 00:43:29.437
So, I'm putting you in your place.

00:43:29.437 --> 00:43:31.687
I'll act my place from now on.

00:43:31.687 --> 00:43:35.117
Please help me just once.

00:43:46.637 --> 00:43:50.027
- Gosh, let's go.
- H-Hold on.

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:53.007
H-Hold on.

00:44:09.507 --> 00:44:11.427
I apologize.

00:44:14.497 --> 00:44:19.037
I told you what to do without knowing my place.

00:44:19.037 --> 00:44:21.617
It was my fault.

00:44:21.617 --> 00:44:23.557
Oh, no...

00:44:23.557 --> 00:44:29.257
I can't tell if you're sincere at all.

00:44:36.187 --> 00:44:39.557
I was rude.

00:44:39.557 --> 00:44:41.377
I sincerely...

00:44:43.087 --> 00:44:44.907
apologize.

00:44:49.507 --> 00:44:52.997
I guess you still have pride.

00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:02.217
What did I do wrong?

00:45:05.877 --> 00:45:09.867
How did you wait for decades
to bully me like this?

00:45:13.577 --> 00:45:17.017
You must be thrilled that
I showed up looking like this.

00:45:17.017 --> 00:45:18.587
Hey, you...

00:45:23.737 --> 00:45:26.747
Don't act surprised.

00:45:26.747 --> 00:45:28.977
You used me as your stooge to humiliate me.

00:45:28.977 --> 00:45:30.977
You think I don't know that?

00:45:32.507 --> 00:45:33.777
Are you crazy?

00:45:33.777 --> 00:45:36.107
That's enough now!

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:40.627
I refuse to shoot a commercial like this.

00:45:40.627 --> 00:45:42.567
I refuse!

00:45:45.827 --> 00:45:48.447
- What's with her...
- Oh, no...

00:45:48.447 --> 00:45:49.777
Are you okay, Ms. Go?

00:45:49.777 --> 00:45:51.847
Director...

00:45:53.207 --> 00:45:55.257
That ahjumma...

00:45:55.257 --> 00:45:58.077
- Geez...
- What's happening?

00:46:01.767 --> 00:46:04.167
- What's this?
- What else? It says right there.

00:46:04.167 --> 00:46:05.967
They're suing to claim a contract breach fee.

00:46:05.967 --> 00:46:09.067
- Contract breach fee?
- They paid you the contract fee.

00:46:09.067 --> 00:46:11.547
You flipped out and scrapped the whole thing.

00:46:11.547 --> 00:46:14.567
I didn't scrap it. Go Hui Yeong is the one-

00:46:14.567 --> 00:46:16.507
Geez. Seriously.

00:46:17.397 --> 00:46:20.777
I refuse to shoot a commercial like this.

00:46:20.777 --> 00:46:22.717
I refuse!

00:46:24.097 --> 00:46:25.897
I talked to Hui Yeong.

00:46:25.897 --> 00:46:29.787
She said she would've backed
down if you apologized.

00:46:29.787 --> 00:46:32.457
Her acting skills improved a lot.

00:46:32.457 --> 00:46:35.207
But why did she get even meaner?

00:46:35.207 --> 00:46:38.137
Excuse me, you need to understand the situation.

00:46:38.137 --> 00:46:39.997
You're the one who's desperate now.

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:43.027
If I knew she plotted this whole thing,

00:46:43.027 --> 00:46:44.837
I wouldn't have set foot in there.

00:46:44.837 --> 00:46:46.877
You did because you needed money.

00:46:46.877 --> 00:46:48.867
You got paid in advance, too.

00:46:48.867 --> 00:46:50.997
That's because...

00:46:53.527 --> 00:46:55.747
If you persuade Hui Yeong,

00:46:55.747 --> 00:46:59.387
the ad agency will take the hit for the reshoot.

00:47:00.387 --> 00:47:02.597
What do you want me to do?

00:47:02.597 --> 00:47:05.097
What am I to do, then?

00:47:09.217 --> 00:47:11.147
Yes, Chief. This is Dokgo Cheol.

00:47:11.147 --> 00:47:14.437
Can I check Ms. Go Hui Yeong's schedule?

00:47:18.327 --> 00:47:19.877
Let's see...

00:47:21.287 --> 00:47:23.497
I don't like the pattern.

00:47:23.497 --> 00:47:28.107
This is a new line Hermaire.

00:47:28.107 --> 00:47:30.777
Should I be grateful for it, then?

00:47:30.777 --> 00:47:32.947
Bring me something else.

00:47:36.457 --> 00:47:40.307
By chance, is that the only thing you got?

00:47:40.307 --> 00:47:45.387
Well, Hermaire is your favorite brand.

00:47:45.387 --> 00:47:49.357
And we were the first one to have the new line.

00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:55.407
Sa Seon Yeong, you've had
it too easy, haven't you?

00:47:55.407 --> 00:47:58.907
So what if I love Hermaire?

00:47:58.907 --> 00:48:02.057
They've never let me be their ambassador.

00:48:02.057 --> 00:48:04.007
What is this, unrequited love?

00:48:04.007 --> 00:48:06.487
T-They said...

00:48:06.487 --> 00:48:10.277
they'll consider you as their
global ambassador next time-

00:48:10.277 --> 00:48:12.297
Next time. Next time. Next time.

00:48:12.297 --> 00:48:14.707
When is that next time, huh?

00:48:14.707 --> 00:48:17.647
Can't you play hard to get?

00:48:17.647 --> 00:48:19.957
They keep acting tentatively.

00:48:19.957 --> 00:48:24.077
You want me to gladly accept their
products and promote them?

00:48:24.077 --> 00:48:26.887
Calm down.

00:48:26.887 --> 00:48:30.617
I'll try talking to them this time.

00:48:30.617 --> 00:48:32.807
What can you do?

00:48:32.807 --> 00:48:36.687
You managed to get here by piggybacking on me.

00:48:36.687 --> 00:48:40.207
What can you do? Huh?

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:57.417
I think it's all about sincerity.

00:49:04.477 --> 00:49:06.817
Noona, should I tell them
to remove the third question?

00:49:06.817 --> 00:49:09.417
I've had romance rumors
with Won Ban plenty of times.

00:49:09.417 --> 00:49:11.247
You'll work with him for the next project, too.

00:49:11.247 --> 00:49:13.337
They could bring up this interview again.

00:49:13.337 --> 00:49:16.237
No problem. It's good to bring more attention.

00:49:16.237 --> 00:49:19.777
Well, yes. It'd add to your chemistry.

00:49:20.717 --> 00:49:22.447
What's this?

00:49:24.187 --> 00:49:25.807
I'm Dokgo Cheol, Bong Cheong Ja's manager.

00:49:25.807 --> 00:49:28.767
Let me talk to you briefly. It won't take long.

00:49:28.767 --> 00:49:30.647
You take care of him.

00:49:31.947 --> 00:49:35.087
I heard you're very angry because of her.

00:49:37.577 --> 00:49:39.207
I'm here to apologize.

00:49:39.207 --> 00:49:40.847
Don't do this here.

00:49:40.847 --> 00:49:42.437
Excuse me.

00:49:43.207 --> 00:49:44.837
Go and tell her.

00:49:44.837 --> 00:49:46.537
That you can't apologize with just words.

00:49:46.537 --> 00:49:50.397
Not through someone else's, especially.

00:49:50.397 --> 00:49:53.447
Would you feel better if I knelt?

00:49:53.447 --> 00:49:55.937
Why? Did Im Se Ra-

00:49:57.367 --> 00:50:01.657
Did Bong Cheong Ja say she'd kneel in front of me?

00:50:10.647 --> 00:50:11.917
Are you crazy?

00:50:11.917 --> 00:50:14.717
I'm kneeling because you said
you can't apologize with words.

00:50:14.717 --> 00:50:16.777
I sincerely apologize.

00:50:16.777 --> 00:50:19.107
Please don't be upset and agree to shoot again.

00:50:19.107 --> 00:50:20.347
I beg you.

00:50:20.347 --> 00:50:22.417
Get up now. Please?

00:50:22.417 --> 00:50:24.747
Get up. People can see you.

00:50:24.747 --> 00:50:26.387
They're taking photos right now.

00:50:26.387 --> 00:50:28.807
I'll get up if you accept the apology.

00:50:28.807 --> 00:50:30.207
What do we do?

00:50:30.207 --> 00:50:32.177
We can't stop the photos from spreading.

00:50:32.177 --> 00:50:33.827
Okay. So, get up.

00:50:33.827 --> 00:50:36.027
I accept your apology.

00:50:37.687 --> 00:50:40.557
- Are you sure?
- I said yes.

00:50:40.557 --> 00:50:42.277
Will you shoot the commercial?

00:50:42.277 --> 00:50:45.877
Please. Get up. I hear you.

00:50:51.877 --> 00:50:54.077
Thank you.

00:50:54.077 --> 00:50:56.507
Gosh, gosh!

00:50:56.507 --> 00:50:58.177
Thank you!

00:51:00.867 --> 00:51:02.897
Is he crazy?

00:51:10.227 --> 00:51:11.957
Is it because I'm old?

00:51:11.957 --> 00:51:14.727
My cheeks, arms,

00:51:14.727 --> 00:51:16.527
and belly fat.

00:51:16.527 --> 00:51:19.887
Why can't I get rid of it?

00:51:19.887 --> 00:51:22.057
Is it really because of age?

00:51:22.957 --> 00:51:26.067
Look. I'm still perfect.

00:51:26.977 --> 00:51:30.877
This elasticity wand takes care of everything.

00:51:30.877 --> 00:51:34.127
Care for yourself and see the difference.

00:51:34.127 --> 00:51:37.047
I want to use it. Me, too. Me, too.

00:51:38.027 --> 00:51:40.157
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

00:51:40.157 --> 00:51:43.627
Geez. What are you doing right now?

00:51:43.627 --> 00:51:45.197
"Jump with vigor."

00:51:45.197 --> 00:51:47.447
Didn't you read it? Huh?

00:51:48.297 --> 00:51:50.407
I did jump with vigor.

00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:53.577
"You want the massage wand. You desire it.

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:56.087
You want to be as pretty as Go Hui Yeong."

00:51:56.087 --> 00:52:00.027
I can't feel your desire and passion.

00:52:00.027 --> 00:52:03.697
I'll try to do better.

00:52:05.307 --> 00:52:07.727
Hey. Go again. Go again.

00:52:07.727 --> 00:52:08.867
Geez.

00:52:08.867 --> 00:52:12.007
This elasticity wand takes care of everything.

00:52:12.007 --> 00:52:14.687
Care for yourself and see the difference.

00:52:14.687 --> 00:52:18.557
I want to use it. Me, too. Me, too.

00:52:18.557 --> 00:52:20.447
Geez, Director.

00:52:20.447 --> 00:52:22.947
Can't you do this? Can't you?

00:52:22.947 --> 00:52:25.267
I'll try just once more.

00:52:26.287 --> 00:52:28.517
Geez. How frustrating.

00:52:28.517 --> 00:52:31.027
Hey, let's go again. Let's go again.

00:52:32.107 --> 00:52:34.667
Care for yourself and see the difference.

00:52:35.667 --> 00:52:39.297
I want to use it. Me, too. Me, too.

00:52:39.297 --> 00:52:40.547
Cut!

00:52:40.547 --> 00:52:43.397
Don't stop me. Don't stop me. I quit. I quit.

00:52:43.397 --> 00:52:45.417
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:52:45.417 --> 00:52:46.827
I'll do better.

00:52:46.827 --> 00:52:49.387
You're so slow.

00:52:49.387 --> 00:52:51.627
Let's go again. Yes.

00:52:53.957 --> 00:52:57.027
Look. I'm still perfect.

00:52:57.027 --> 00:53:00.017
Care for yourself and see the difference.

00:53:00.017 --> 00:53:04.407
I want to use it. Me, too. Me, too.

00:53:04.407 --> 00:53:06.137
Me, too.

00:53:20.957 --> 00:53:24.147
Cut! Okay.

00:53:25.147 --> 00:53:27.737
That was great, Hui Yeong.

00:53:27.737 --> 00:53:30.037
You really are a great actor.

00:53:30.037 --> 00:53:31.427
Come on.

00:53:31.427 --> 00:53:33.947
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

00:53:33.947 --> 00:53:36.727
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

00:53:36.727 --> 00:53:39.257
Thank you!

00:53:40.597 --> 00:53:42.597
Thank you.

00:53:42.597 --> 00:53:44.457
Are you okay?

00:53:45.567 --> 00:53:47.017
You did well.

00:53:47.827 --> 00:53:49.417
Get up.

00:53:50.467 --> 00:53:52.827
- What's wrong?
- My shoulder...

00:53:52.827 --> 00:53:55.187
You hurt it when you fell.

00:53:55.187 --> 00:53:57.357
Where? Here?

00:53:58.947 --> 00:54:00.747
Get up.

00:54:02.317 --> 00:54:03.577
Do your legs hurt, too?

00:54:03.577 --> 00:54:06.037
I sprained it earlier.

00:54:06.037 --> 00:54:07.747
Let's go for now.

00:54:07.747 --> 00:54:11.847
There's a physical therapy center
I know. Let's go there.

00:54:13.457 --> 00:54:15.707
You need to do the voice-over next.

00:54:15.707 --> 00:54:18.467
Should I get the car ready?

00:54:18.467 --> 00:54:23.297
Hey, can you kneel for me?

00:54:23.297 --> 00:54:25.817
Why do you suddenly ask that...

00:54:25.817 --> 00:54:29.187
Just answer me. Can you or can't you?

00:54:29.187 --> 00:54:32.677
I've never knelt before in my life.

00:54:34.547 --> 00:54:36.207
Seriously.

00:54:36.207 --> 00:54:38.807
Noona, I will. I can kneel.

00:54:38.807 --> 00:54:39.937
Noona?

00:54:39.937 --> 00:54:42.327
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:54:59.147 --> 00:55:00.847
Thank you.

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:10.337
I don't know why you changed your mind,

00:55:11.357 --> 00:55:14.507
but you decided to shoot again.

00:55:14.507 --> 00:55:18.627
I sincerely thank you.

00:55:18.627 --> 00:55:21.747
Do you really not know or...

00:55:21.747 --> 00:55:24.647
are you pretending?

00:55:24.647 --> 00:55:26.487
What do you mean?

00:55:26.487 --> 00:55:29.517
You still have some pride left.

00:55:29.517 --> 00:55:31.667
You forced him to apologize for you.

00:55:31.667 --> 00:55:33.777
Don't act ignorant.

00:55:35.217 --> 00:55:37.817
What are you talking about?

00:55:37.817 --> 00:55:41.947
Your manager came to see me.

00:55:41.947 --> 00:55:46.247
He apologized and begged in front
of everyone. What was I to do?

00:55:47.797 --> 00:55:50.597
I decided to shoot to help him out.

00:55:50.597 --> 00:55:53.227
I did it for your manager.

00:55:54.567 --> 00:55:57.647
Is that true?

00:55:59.827 --> 00:56:01.837
Wow.

00:56:01.837 --> 00:56:05.367
You've always been an amazing actor.

00:56:05.367 --> 00:56:06.867
Why don't you say,

00:56:07.907 --> 00:56:11.337
"No. I didn't know."

00:56:12.427 --> 00:56:14.007
Why don't you?

00:56:16.167 --> 00:56:21.547
You know, I did some humiliating
things, but I did them.

00:56:21.547 --> 00:56:23.647
But what about you?

00:56:23.647 --> 00:56:26.277
You acted as if you could do anything for acting.

00:56:26.277 --> 00:56:29.637
But you wouldn't do anything
you don't feel like doing.

00:56:29.637 --> 00:56:34.307
But now, you made your manager apologize for you?

00:56:37.737 --> 00:56:42.287
You're in this mess
because you did it to yourself.

00:56:42.287 --> 00:56:45.407
You did it to yourself, I said.

00:57:20.357 --> 00:57:22.977
What took you so long?

00:57:22.977 --> 00:57:25.297
I talked to the physical therapy center.

00:57:25.297 --> 00:57:26.627
They close at seven normally,

00:57:26.627 --> 00:57:29.427
but I begged them to stay open until eight.

00:57:29.427 --> 00:57:30.997
Let's...

00:57:34.037 --> 00:57:36.637
Why did you do that? Why?

00:57:36.637 --> 00:57:40.057
Why? Why?

00:57:41.207 --> 00:57:42.767
Did something happen?

00:57:42.767 --> 00:57:45.637
Why do you make me so miserable?

00:57:45.637 --> 00:57:49.787
Who... Who asked you to apologize for me?

00:57:54.077 --> 00:57:56.387
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:57:57.467 --> 00:57:59.247
I didn't even know.

00:57:59.247 --> 00:58:03.567
I thanked Go Hui Yeong like a fool.

00:58:04.507 --> 00:58:06.857
Why does it matter who apologized?

00:58:06.857 --> 00:58:09.557
- It was an urgent situation.
- It matters to me.

00:58:09.557 --> 00:58:12.077
Because it's Go Hui Yeong, not just anyone else.

00:58:12.077 --> 00:58:15.987
To Go Hui Yeong, of all people, you...

00:58:15.987 --> 00:58:19.567
you... of all people...

00:58:20.937 --> 00:58:23.917
Of all people, you...

00:58:23.917 --> 00:58:25.987
Of all people...

00:58:53.637 --> 00:58:55.607
I'm your manager.

00:58:58.347 --> 00:59:01.677
It's my job to protect my actor.

00:59:02.637 --> 00:59:04.737
Why didn't you...

00:59:04.737 --> 00:59:08.877
Why didn't you just persuade me? Why didn't you?

00:59:10.807 --> 00:59:12.787
I didn't want to do that.

00:59:13.727 --> 00:59:16.037
You get your feelings hurt

00:59:16.037 --> 00:59:18.887
by the actors who aren't as good as you...

00:59:19.857 --> 00:59:22.147
I didn't want that to happen again.

00:59:27.007 --> 00:59:28.957
What's so great about me?

00:59:28.957 --> 00:59:32.237
What's so great about little old me?

00:59:33.967 --> 00:59:35.917
I told you before.

00:59:37.127 --> 00:59:39.207
As your true manager,

00:59:40.227 --> 00:59:42.677
I'll help you by your side.

00:59:45.667 --> 00:59:49.617
I can kneel in front of her a hundred
times if it's for my actor.

00:59:49.617 --> 00:59:52.717
I'm good at kneeling. I did it a lot in school.

01:00:05.837 --> 01:00:07.477
Here. Let's get up.

01:00:07.477 --> 01:00:11.007
Here. Let's get up. Yes.

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:15.767
So, you'll extend your legs,

01:00:15.767 --> 01:00:20.487
straighten your shoulders, and stand tall.

01:00:20.487 --> 01:00:22.207
Okay?

01:00:27.137 --> 01:00:28.677
Okay.

01:00:28.677 --> 01:00:30.187
Let's go.

01:00:30.187 --> 01:00:32.907
Let's go. Let's go.

01:00:34.477 --> 01:00:35.867
Okay.

01:00:49.367 --> 01:00:51.657
- It's Mr. Gu.
- Mr .Gu.

01:00:51.657 --> 01:00:53.517
Mr. Gu, how do you feel about the drama ending?

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:55.717
You've worked so hard.

01:00:55.717 --> 01:00:57.127
It's the radish slap lady.

01:00:57.127 --> 01:00:59.977
Over there! It's her!

01:00:59.977 --> 01:01:02.847
- We enjoyed the drama.
- It was so fun.

01:01:02.847 --> 01:01:04.147
Tell us how you feel.

01:01:04.147 --> 01:01:07.057
- Thank you.
- You look great.

01:01:07.057 --> 01:01:09.837
Thank you so much.

01:01:09.837 --> 01:01:11.417
Please look this way.

01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:13.357
Radish lady!

01:01:18.527 --> 01:01:22.537
Since that day, I don't even look at a radish.

01:01:22.537 --> 01:01:24.837
You know I almost broke my molar, right?

01:01:24.837 --> 01:01:27.537
- I almost got an implant. Look.
- Okay, okay.

01:01:27.537 --> 01:01:29.007
Did you see it?

01:01:29.007 --> 01:01:34.187
Hey, an ad-lib has to be consensual, right?

01:01:34.187 --> 01:01:36.757
Wasn't it an ad-lib when you pushed Ms. Bong?

01:01:36.757 --> 01:01:38.557
Hey, that was...

01:01:38.557 --> 01:01:41.137
It's because I got emotional.

01:01:41.137 --> 01:01:42.907
She must've, too.

01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:44.807
Geez. Why...

01:01:44.807 --> 01:01:47.597
I can't talk to these kids.

01:01:47.597 --> 01:01:51.437
Geez. The time has changed.

01:01:51.437 --> 01:01:53.127
I have to tiptoe around the staff.

01:01:53.127 --> 01:01:55.597
Sunbaenim, let me take a selfie with you.

01:01:55.597 --> 01:01:57.757
Okay. Selfie...

01:01:57.757 --> 01:01:59.267
I'm a fan.

01:01:59.267 --> 01:02:01.547
- Me, too.
- You're so pretty.

01:02:01.547 --> 01:02:03.027
Wow, daebak.

01:02:03.027 --> 01:02:04.267
I'm a fan. I really am.

01:02:04.267 --> 01:02:06.517
Should we take a selfie?

01:02:06.517 --> 01:02:09.457
Hey, are you here? Yeah.

01:02:10.787 --> 01:02:12.897
Want a picture?

01:02:12.897 --> 01:02:14.807

[Love Is Not a Crime]
The radish cake is here.

01:02:22.687 --> 01:02:24.257
Is it a radish?

01:02:25.517 --> 01:02:28.247
Don't be upset, Noona.

01:02:28.247 --> 01:02:32.567
Bong Cheong Ja! Bong Cheong Ja!
Bong Cheong Ja!

01:02:32.567 --> 01:02:34.617
Go out.

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:36.167
Don't.

01:02:39.267 --> 01:02:42.557
We'll have a cake-cutting ceremony.

01:02:42.557 --> 01:02:44.437
Hold it with me.

01:02:44.437 --> 01:02:46.167
Applause!

01:02:46.167 --> 01:02:47.687
[Thank you, everyone]

01:02:50.437 --> 01:02:53.847
Lastly, let's welcome Ms. Chu.

01:02:53.847 --> 01:02:56.357
Please make a speech!

01:02:58.867 --> 01:03:02.327
My work wasn't perfect,
but I was able to be a part of

01:03:02.327 --> 01:03:05.017
a top drama, thanks to these talented people.

01:03:05.017 --> 01:03:06.107
Thank you.

01:03:06.107 --> 01:03:09.977
Ms. Chu, they say your next drama
will be streaming. Is that true?

01:03:19.517 --> 01:03:23.307
Ms. Chu, I'm so happy for you.

01:03:23.307 --> 01:03:25.097
Thank you so much.

01:03:25.097 --> 01:03:28.147
I heard you recommended my script.

01:03:28.147 --> 01:03:29.577
I did?

01:03:29.577 --> 01:03:31.057
Don't play ignorant.

01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:34.487
CEO Kang from Two One told me.

01:03:34.487 --> 01:03:35.927
Huh? There it was.

01:03:35.927 --> 01:03:37.227
I looked for it everywhere.

01:03:37.227 --> 01:03:39.137
I love stories like that.

01:03:39.137 --> 01:03:41.097
A nobody side character surviving
until the end, carrying the story,

01:03:41.097 --> 01:03:43.617
and defeating all the lead characters.

01:03:45.467 --> 01:03:50.567
Meeting you was the greatest

Im Se Ra.

01:03:56.637 --> 01:03:58.157
Im Se Ra.

01:03:58.157 --> 01:04:00.047
Hey, Im Se Ra!

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:03.987
Im Se Ra.

01:04:06.157 --> 01:04:08.037
Mr. Gu is really drunk.

01:04:08.037 --> 01:04:09.767
Why is he looking for Im Se Ra here?

01:04:09.767 --> 01:04:11.577
I know.

01:04:18.727 --> 01:04:20.327
Where's Im Se Ra?

01:04:20.327 --> 01:04:21.967
Why is he looking for Im Se Ra?

01:04:21.967 --> 01:04:23.617
He's very drunk.

01:04:24.447 --> 01:04:25.937
Im Se Ra?

01:04:26.687 --> 01:04:28.757
Who's Im Se Ra?

01:04:29.677 --> 01:04:31.517
Aren't you Im Se Ra?

01:04:36.267 --> 01:04:37.607
Hey.

01:04:38.587 --> 01:04:41.517
I got you the part,

01:04:41.517 --> 01:04:45.297
but you slap me with a radish? Huh?

01:04:51.447 --> 01:04:52.727
Come out.

01:04:52.727 --> 01:04:54.877
- Right now?
- Hurry.

01:04:58.297 --> 01:05:00.117
Hey, Im Se Ra!

01:05:00.117 --> 01:05:01.837
Im Se Ra...

01:05:03.207 --> 01:05:05.557
What are you doing?

01:05:05.557 --> 01:05:07.507
An article came out.

01:05:07.507 --> 01:05:09.537
What article?

01:05:11.817 --> 01:05:13.917
[Is Bong Cheong Ja Im Se Ra?]

01:05:13.917 --> 01:05:15.577
H-How did they...

01:05:15.577 --> 01:05:17.947
The reporters who left are coming back.

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:19.927
Let's get out. Now.

01:05:22.167 --> 01:05:25.037
Ms. Im Se Ra! Ms. Im Se Ra!

01:05:25.037 --> 01:05:26.187
You're Im Se Ra, right?

01:05:26.187 --> 01:05:28.087
Why did you hide the fact that you were Im Se Ra?

01:05:28.087 --> 01:05:30.117
Bong Cheong Ja is your real name, right?

01:05:30.117 --> 01:05:31.587
Ms. Im, look over here!

01:05:31.587 --> 01:05:34.937
Did you come back after the
accident due to financial reasons?

01:05:34.937 --> 01:05:36.267
Please answer me.

01:05:36.267 --> 01:05:38.327
Bong Cheong Ja is Im Se Ra, correct?

01:05:38.327 --> 01:05:39.547
You're Im Se Ra, aren't you?

01:05:39.547 --> 01:05:41.647
Please don't take photos.

01:05:41.647 --> 01:05:43.177
Hold on.

01:05:44.097 --> 01:05:45.607
You can run, right?

01:05:45.607 --> 01:05:48.167
- What?
- We'll run at a count to three.

01:05:48.167 --> 01:05:51.177
But the reporters are blocking. How...

01:05:51.177 --> 01:05:54.397
One, two, three.

01:05:54.397 --> 01:05:55.897

[Epilogue]

01:06:47.167 --> 01:06:50.107
I knew Mr. Won had to be the male lead.

01:06:50.107 --> 01:06:52.747
He can act. He's handsome.

01:06:52.747 --> 01:06:55.077
The programming is perfectly set up.

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:56.597
As you've mentioned before,

01:06:56.597 --> 01:07:00.207
this definitely will be
Im Se Ra's comeback, right?

01:07:00.207 --> 01:07:01.907
Come on, Mr. Ban.

01:07:01.907 --> 01:07:04.667
Just make sure Mr. Won doesn't go anywhere.

01:07:04.667 --> 01:07:08.767
We'll prepare everything and
come pick him up. Okay?

01:07:08.767 --> 01:07:10.467
Got it.

01:07:12.347 --> 01:07:14.047
[Miscasting]

01:07:14.047 --> 01:07:17.147
Ban, will you really work on this project?
[Miscasting]

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:22.067
It will be in the programming,
thanks to you, but I'm not a fan.

01:07:23.067 --> 01:07:25.797
You're Won Ban, after all.
You should be the only star,

01:07:25.797 --> 01:07:28.107
but your co-star is Go Hui Yeong,
who's greedy with parts.

01:07:28.107 --> 01:07:29.947
Would you be okay?

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:35.317
The script itself is pretty attractive. And...

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:37.677
And what? What else is there?

01:07:38.637 --> 01:07:42.487
I heard Im Se Ra is playing the Im Sun part.

01:07:42.487 --> 01:07:46.367
Is that why you agreed to do it?

01:07:46.367 --> 01:07:50.117
I think I heard a rumor about you dating her.

01:07:50.117 --> 01:07:51.947
Was it true?

01:07:52.947 --> 01:07:54.267
It's not like that.

01:07:54.267 --> 01:07:56.477
Right? No, right?

01:07:56.477 --> 01:07:58.617
I had a crush on her.

01:08:01.767 --> 01:08:05.777
Im Se Ra is my first love.

01:08:05.777 --> 01:08:08.907

♫ The unreachable longing ♫

What's so great about that industry?

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:05.107
Why go back and be treated like that?

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:07.077
I'll turn everything back.

01:09:07.077 --> 01:09:10.317
Make sure to take care of her before the election.

01:09:10.317 --> 01:09:12.037
The police are already after us.

01:09:12.037 --> 01:09:15.467
Who are you, anyway?

01:09:15.467 --> 01:09:18.127
How dare you plug Im Se Ra?

01:09:18.127 --> 01:09:20.317
It's my project, not yours.

01:09:20.317 --> 01:09:23.257
I'll make sure to win this role.

01:09:23.257 --> 01:09:28.437
Look forward to it. My revenge starts now.
