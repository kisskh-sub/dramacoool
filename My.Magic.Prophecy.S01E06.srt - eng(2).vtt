WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Tul!

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.460
In!

00:00:03.752 --> 00:00:04.768
I’m In’s boyfriend.

00:00:04.808 --> 00:00:06.376
Why did you lie to Tul?

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.264
I didn’t lie.

00:00:07.296 --> 00:00:08.800
I was planning to hit on you anyway.

00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:09.928
My rival is here.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.336
I have to make a move now, right?

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.672
I’ve been meaning to ask you.

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:14.660
Are you dating anyone?

00:00:14.688 --> 00:00:15.976
As if I have time for that.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:16.752
Good.

00:00:16.784 --> 00:00:18.104
Don’t you feel bad for In at all?

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:18.904
Why?

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:20.992
He has to turn you down over and over.

00:00:21.032 --> 00:00:23.352
Have you ever thought about
how hard that is for him?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.104
Don’t like me, Thap.

00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:28.440
I don’t want to have anyone
only to lose them again.

00:00:28.616 --> 00:00:29.640
I promise

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:32.870
I won’t ever leave you.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.680
Good morning, In.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.072
Come here.

00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:35.984
Why?

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.560
I’m checking your temperature.

00:01:39.608 --> 00:01:40.608
Come over here.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.640
Come.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.640
No more fever.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.476
But I think you’re at risk of
another health problem.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.600
What problem?

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.224
A heart attack.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.840
Thap!

00:02:35.872 --> 00:02:37.016
What the?

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.392
Ow, that hurts.

00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:41.080
Don’t push me—I’m already in my 30s.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.430
What?

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.320
What?

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.512
You have a dimple?

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.368
Yeah. You like it?

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.010
Do you like my dimple, or do you like me?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.820
Hm?

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.240
Gosh, Thap.

00:03:22.408 --> 00:03:23.672
I forgot my blanket.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.710
Here.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.880
Thap!

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.712
Yes, In?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.976
Ton, it’s me.

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:12.360
Thap, Mrs. Tara can
breathe on her own now.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400
Hm?

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.824
So, who knows about this?

00:04:18.248 --> 00:04:20.272
Just me, Ton, and Doctor Tom.

00:04:20.288 --> 00:04:21.288
Mm.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.624
Then hurry and move her
to a negative pressure room.

00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:27.752
If anyone asks, tell them I ordered it.

00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:28.368
Okay?

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.224
But wouldn’t it look suspicious to
move her without an explanation?

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.560
Gosh, screw that.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.664
Just say it’s a drug-resistant infection
or Covid, anything.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.168
And no visitors, except you, me, and Ton.

00:04:43.352 --> 00:04:44.984
What about Karn?

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.528
I don’t think we should include him.

00:04:47.552 --> 00:04:49.296
Karn’s in management.

00:04:49.328 --> 00:04:51.040
Word about the corruption could travel.

00:04:51.232 --> 00:04:53.672
Yeah, I’m with you on that.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.336
Ton, In had another dream.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:58.448
This time, it was in Mae Hong Son.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.712
Yeah, your safety is my concern.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.464
Thap, you might need to
come back to Bangkok sooner.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.450
Thap.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.580
Thap?

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.376
You still there?

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.070
Mm.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.320
Well, well, Tiger.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.600
In, isn’t it?

00:05:26.097 --> 00:05:27.143
I think…

00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:31.269
I like him a lot, guys.

00:07:17.641 --> 00:07:20.453
I already told Ton about your dream.

00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:24.821
What did Ton say?

00:07:25.565 --> 00:07:27.561
We might need to
head back to Bangkok earlier.

00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:34.869
That’s good.

00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:38.085
You probably want to
get back to work already.

00:07:42.341 --> 00:07:44.141
If it’s not about work,

00:07:44.173 --> 00:07:45.733
I don’t want to leave at all, you know?

00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:02.401
Thap.

00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:03.501
Yes?

00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:09.669
Yesterday, when we…

00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:12.485
kissed…

00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:18.045
Tul isn’t here anymore.

00:08:18.391 --> 00:08:19.877
You can stop playing around.

00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:55.077
I don’t play with someone I don’t like, In.

00:08:56.691 --> 00:09:00.349
You only dream about
someone important, right?

00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:06.773
So if you’re dreaming about me
right after your parents,

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:11.645
then I must matter
almost as much as your soulmate.

00:09:17.091 --> 00:09:19.437
You’re pretty cocky.

00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:28.173
Come on. Finish hanging all the clothes.

00:09:34.691 --> 00:09:36.261
If you don’t believe me,

00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:39.389
read my fortune and see.

00:09:46.881 --> 00:09:48.941
Why do you want a reading all of a sudden?

00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:50.653
Do you believe fortune tellers now?

00:09:53.211 --> 00:09:54.533
I believe Fortune Teller In.

00:09:57.921 --> 00:09:59.229
But I don’t want to read it.

00:10:00.321 --> 00:10:02.641
I don’t want to know
what bad things you will have to face.

00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:05.121
We can read about something else then.

00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:07.893
About what?

00:10:09.891 --> 00:10:10.891
Love.

00:10:14.291 --> 00:10:15.469
You didn’t learn your lesson?

00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:18.091
Why?

00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:22.861
If the cards say someone isn’t
your soulmate, you’d just give up?

00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:28.501
I don’t know.

00:10:29.121 --> 00:10:30.201
I don’t have a partner yet.

00:10:30.821 --> 00:10:31.581
Good.

00:10:31.845 --> 00:10:32.845
Very good.

00:10:33.371 --> 00:10:34.485
Let’s do the reading now.

00:10:40.091 --> 00:10:42.973
I want to know if I’ve found my soulmate yet.

00:10:43.453 --> 00:10:44.133
Ow.

00:10:44.157 --> 00:10:45.829
- Thap.
- What?

00:10:46.091 --> 00:10:47.581
Concentrate,

00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:50.477
ask what you really want to know,

00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:52.861
and then pick three cards.

00:11:23.601 --> 00:11:24.601
There.

00:11:25.761 --> 00:11:29.421
Mr. Fortune Teller, you can’t be
more eager than your client here.

00:11:31.731 --> 00:11:33.141
Just pick the card. Hurry up.

00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:09.711
You’ve found them.

00:12:09.845 --> 00:12:11.841
What? I have?

00:12:11.877 --> 00:12:12.893
But…

00:12:13.281 --> 00:12:15.237
you’re not sure yet
whether you’ll be together.

00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:19.269
That’s accurate.

00:12:19.581 --> 00:12:23.861
It’s someone you came across by chance
and ended up helping each other.

00:12:23.901 --> 00:12:24.917
Hold on a sec.

00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:28.541
Are you trying to make
the reading about yourself?

00:12:29.731 --> 00:12:31.445
Stop being ridiculous, Thap.

00:12:33.801 --> 00:12:38.157
Alright. I want to know if
the person is older or younger than me.

00:12:38.181 --> 00:12:38.997
Younger.

00:12:39.021 --> 00:12:40.349
Younger?

00:12:42.231 --> 00:12:43.285
The cards told you that?

00:12:43.485 --> 00:12:44.677
Yes!

00:12:45.511 --> 00:12:46.853
It’s what the cards say.

00:12:47.371 --> 00:12:48.493
Well, just checking.

00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:52.557
I want to know one more thing

00:12:52.911 --> 00:12:58.181
Does the person have a noticeable feature,
like a birthmark or mole?

00:12:58.241 --> 00:12:59.241
Yes, moles.

00:13:00.151 --> 00:13:00.925
Yes.

00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:01.949
Yes?

00:13:04.645 --> 00:13:05.645
Here.

00:13:06.681 --> 00:13:07.681
Like this.

00:13:08.611 --> 00:13:10.173
They have something like this.

00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:12.517
But I don’t think it’s me.

00:13:16.011 --> 00:13:17.205
And just why wouldn’t you be?

00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:19.845
I don’t think it’s me.

00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:36.077
I want this.

00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:44.325
You don’t have to believe the reading.

00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:52.021
Mr. Fortune Teller,

00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:54.277
I’m Mrs. Thepee’s son.

00:13:55.281 --> 00:13:56.973
I’m superstitious.

00:14:13.741 --> 00:14:15.557
Move. I’m collecting my cards.

00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:19.121
Please handle that, Doctor.

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:20.149
Of course.

00:14:27.931 --> 00:14:29.461
She will wake up soon, right?

00:14:30.261 --> 00:14:33.453
If Kasidis finds out, she won’t.

00:14:41.341 --> 00:14:42.317
Give me a high five!

00:14:42.357 --> 00:14:43.741
Come here. Let’s boost our energy.

00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:48.413
One, two… yay!

00:14:48.437 --> 00:14:49.637
Pass it here.

00:14:49.669 --> 00:14:50.829
Go over there. There.

00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:52.501
Go.

00:14:53.731 --> 00:14:54.731
Come here.

00:14:57.311 --> 00:15:00.589
Yeah!

00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:07.861
Argh! Run, run!

00:15:07.901 --> 00:15:08.885
Run over there fast!

00:15:08.917 --> 00:15:09.941
There.

00:15:23.141 --> 00:15:24.045
Look at you.

00:15:24.077 --> 00:15:25.821
Kids are so energetic.

00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:28.165
I’m exhausted. Let me take a break.

00:15:28.557 --> 00:15:30.561
You’re playing too hard for your age.

00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:34.013
Hey, you wanna test my strength?

00:15:40.241 --> 00:15:42.477
Gosh, you’re drenched in sweat.

00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:43.801
I am.

00:15:44.081 --> 00:15:45.837
Where’s Auntie Pian?

00:15:46.201 --> 00:15:47.201
At church.

00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:49.949
Oh, she’s a Christian?

00:15:50.201 --> 00:15:51.201
She is.

00:15:51.491 --> 00:15:53.973
She became one after having a kid.

00:15:53.997 --> 00:15:56.469
Ah. What about you, Uncle Ju?

00:15:57.131 --> 00:15:58.869
I still go to temples, like before.

00:15:59.081 --> 00:16:04.717
So, will you two still be here
to join the New Year’s party?

00:16:07.171 --> 00:16:09.189
Khaohom, come here, honey.

00:16:10.365 --> 00:16:12.061
Come.

00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:15.437
Tell In what you want him to do.

00:16:16.331 --> 00:16:19.453
I want to hear you sing again.

00:16:22.241 --> 00:16:24.077
You want to hear him sing?

00:16:31.361 --> 00:16:33.701
It’s fine if you’re not up for it.

00:16:34.021 --> 00:16:39.661
My villagers and I still want
you two to join us anyway.

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:41.613
Especially you, Thap.

00:16:41.637 --> 00:16:42.109
Yes?

00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:44.525
When you first came,
people didn’t know you well yet.

00:16:44.557 --> 00:16:47.909
But now, you’ve become
one of their favorites.

00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:50.701
Come on, Uncle. I’m not.

00:16:50.741 --> 00:16:51.741
Please.

00:16:51.921 --> 00:16:55.461
If you can, stay and join us.

00:16:56.831 --> 00:16:58.125
I’ll let you know later.

00:17:03.091 --> 00:17:04.861
Right? Do you want them to?

00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:13.961
Do you want to
celebrate the New Year here?

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:16.877
What about you?

00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:19.371
I want to stay here with you, of course.

00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:22.653
But Ton wants us to go back early.

00:17:23.521 --> 00:17:24.821
Unless you want to stay.

00:17:25.161 --> 00:17:26.469
I’m worried about you.

00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:31.365
Hey, In.

00:17:31.397 --> 00:17:32.397
In.

00:17:34.801 --> 00:17:35.801
Let’s go sit down.

00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:48.421
How are you?

00:17:48.711 --> 00:17:50.069
I’m not seeing anything.

00:17:50.917 --> 00:17:53.149
Maybe it’s because I warned you just now.

00:17:54.431 --> 00:17:56.461
Then from now on,

00:17:56.501 --> 00:17:58.013
whatever you see, don’t warn me.

00:17:58.721 --> 00:18:00.061
The only thing I need

00:18:01.653 --> 00:18:03.651
is for you to hold my hand like this.

00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:13.253
The visions reveal themselves
only to keep us on guard.

00:18:15.101 --> 00:18:17.165
We’ve gotten through
your bad dreams twice already,

00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:19.851
we can do it together again this time.

00:18:25.077 --> 00:18:26.077
Mm.

00:18:28.411 --> 00:18:29.597
Hey, hey!

00:18:31.601 --> 00:18:33.253
Oh, shit.

00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:34.413
In, go hide.

00:18:34.437 --> 00:18:35.037
Hide.

00:18:35.077 --> 00:18:38.261
Hey, hey.

00:18:39.071 --> 00:18:40.533
Auntie Jan!

00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:43.173
Auntie Jan asked me to give you this.

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:44.077
Come. Come.

00:18:44.133 --> 00:18:45.325
Come quick.

00:18:51.511 --> 00:18:53.861
Uh… thank you.

00:18:56.601 --> 00:18:58.309
I did it.

00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:02.005
Is he a local here?

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:09.293
Whatever. Let’s get inside.

00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:18.591
Doc!

00:19:19.611 --> 00:19:20.789
Where’s my wife?

00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:24.717
We relocated the patient
to the quarantine area, sir. She has Covid.

00:19:25.201 --> 00:19:27.021
You can’t do that!

00:19:27.061 --> 00:19:28.317
You did it without my consent.

00:19:28.349 --> 00:19:31.197
I’m her husband. Why wasn’t I notified first?

00:19:31.373 --> 00:19:32.589
We sincerely apologize, sir.

00:19:32.613 --> 00:19:33.445
Please, calm down.

00:19:33.461 --> 00:19:37.293
I had to act urgently
to ensure the patient’s safety.

00:19:37.341 --> 00:19:39.661
And no visitors are allowed at this time.

00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:41.557
I hope you understand.

00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:52.301
Every time I look at Mrs. Tara,
I feel bad for her.

00:19:52.325 --> 00:19:54.637
If she wakes up and learns
her husband is a suspect

00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:57.373
in her parents’ murder and in trying to kill her,

00:19:57.671 --> 00:19:59.205
how heartbroken will she be?

00:19:59.373 --> 00:20:04.533
Good thing Dr. Pokpong
can help support her heart.

00:20:06.381 --> 00:20:08.101
I’m not supporting like that.

00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:10.861
But I want to support yours.

00:20:12.081 --> 00:20:13.669
I want to be your ECSO.

00:20:14.741 --> 00:20:16.117
It’s ECMO.

00:20:16.389 --> 00:20:19.309
If you’re going to joke with heart specialists,
at least do your homework.

00:20:21.933 --> 00:20:23.637
My joke might be off,

00:20:24.921 --> 00:20:27.453
but you can trust me to do my homework.

00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:28.891
You jerk.

00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:31.309
Go play over there.

00:20:33.213 --> 00:20:34.693
But I want to play right here.

00:20:34.725 --> 00:20:35.725
You have a problem?

00:20:36.581 --> 00:20:39.421
Did my hospital turn into a police station?

00:20:39.461 --> 00:20:40.869
Some officer keeps coming in.

00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:42.637
I’m here for work.

00:20:44.061 --> 00:20:45.653
Just for work?

00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:48.093
I thought you were here to go after a doctor.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.021
And he’s playing so hard to get.

00:20:52.011 --> 00:20:53.573
It’s not like I have so much time.

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:55.749
You want my help?

00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:58.661
How about dinner, all three of us?

00:20:59.361 --> 00:21:01.161
Waiting for you two to set it up on your own?

00:21:01.561 --> 00:21:02.921
Not gonna happen in this lifetime.

00:21:05.613 --> 00:21:06.877
What do you say, heart doctor?

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:08.851
Gosh.

00:21:28.165 --> 00:21:29.437
Karn bailed on us.

00:21:29.485 --> 00:21:30.525
That’s good.

00:21:30.971 --> 00:21:32.501
So it can just be us.

00:21:32.525 --> 00:21:34.069
Did you plan this with him?

00:21:34.109 --> 00:21:35.669
Like hell, I didn’t.

00:21:35.701 --> 00:21:37.245
I don’t have that much free time.

00:21:38.081 --> 00:21:40.041
I did book a table
at your favorite place, though.

00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:43.071
Get in already.

00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:52.877
Here, choose the music.

00:21:54.721 --> 00:21:55.721
Hey.

00:21:56.121 --> 00:21:57.269
This is Kadaew.

00:21:57.481 --> 00:21:58.645
You remember him?

00:21:58.677 --> 00:21:59.829
Of course.

00:22:00.221 --> 00:22:01.693
I named him myself.

00:22:04.861 --> 00:22:08.813
No one else besides you
would name a dog Kadaew.

00:22:12.081 --> 00:22:14.477
Hey, how’s he doing?

00:22:18.361 --> 00:22:19.525
He…

00:22:24.951 --> 00:22:26.133
He’s doing fine.

00:22:26.173 --> 00:22:27.701
Look at how sad you look.

00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:30.413
He’s very old, though.

00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:32.205
I miss him.

00:22:32.237 --> 00:22:33.525
Go see him if you do.

00:22:36.661 --> 00:22:38.261
He’s at the same place, waiting for you.

00:22:41.431 --> 00:22:42.501
Just drive already.

00:22:44.181 --> 00:22:45.261
Yes, sir.

00:23:04.961 --> 00:23:08.749
Are you here to eat or to look at my face?

00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:10.421
You seem to enjoy your food.

00:23:10.851 --> 00:23:11.851
It’s cute.

00:23:19.281 --> 00:23:20.453
Excuse me.

00:23:20.841 --> 00:23:24.733
Would anyone here happen to drive
a car with the license plate 424?

00:23:24.757 --> 00:23:25.757
That’d be mine.

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:27.645
Your car window has been smashed, sir.

00:23:32.661 --> 00:23:33.869
Damn it!

00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:48.901
Excuse me.

00:23:48.933 --> 00:23:49.461
Yes, sir.

00:23:49.493 --> 00:23:51.341
May I see the footage from the CCTV?

00:23:51.357 --> 00:23:52.357
Of course.

00:23:55.821 --> 00:23:57.669
STOP WORKING THIS CASE
IF YOU WANT NO TROUBLE.

00:23:57.901 --> 00:23:58.901
What is it?

00:23:59.911 --> 00:24:03.061
Someone’s threatening me
to stop working on my case.

00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:04.301
What are you going to do?

00:24:04.333 --> 00:24:05.421
I’m never gonna stop.

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:07.611
If they think they can stop me, let them try.

00:24:12.821 --> 00:24:15.245
Pong, are you scared?

00:24:16.781 --> 00:24:17.781
No.

00:24:18.101 --> 00:24:20.445
If you keep going, I’m with you.

00:24:36.731 --> 00:24:37.731
Ow.

00:24:38.371 --> 00:24:39.371
Thap!

00:24:40.171 --> 00:24:41.829
Hey, what are you thinking?

00:24:46.541 --> 00:24:49.021
Drink this and tell me later.

00:24:49.053 --> 00:24:50.053
I can wait.

00:25:13.037 --> 00:25:14.461
Will you tell me now?

00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:15.811
Hm?

00:25:16.231 --> 00:25:17.231
What are you thinking?

00:25:17.981 --> 00:25:19.981
Ever since you broke up with your ex,

00:25:21.011 --> 00:25:22.381
you’ve never dated anyone?

00:25:22.681 --> 00:25:23.349
That’s right.

00:25:23.589 --> 00:25:26.261
Whoa, that’s a long time.

00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:28.647
How did you manage to stay single
until I came along?

00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:31.861
Why? Are you saying I’m that good?

00:25:41.241 --> 00:25:44.861
Someone this good
belongs to you, Mr. Inthu.

00:25:54.441 --> 00:25:59.085
Does that mean…

00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:01.325
you accept me as your boyfriend?

00:26:04.571 --> 00:26:06.131
Are you a doctor or a badminton player?

00:26:06.711 --> 00:26:08.351
You never miss when you drop those lines.

00:26:09.521 --> 00:26:10.869
Is that a yes?

00:26:16.131 --> 00:26:17.131
Not yet.

00:26:17.321 --> 00:26:18.321
You have to wait.

00:26:22.661 --> 00:26:25.277
And how long do I have to wait?

00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:27.685
I don’t know that either.

00:26:34.531 --> 00:26:36.051
Consider that my way of reserving you.

00:26:40.241 --> 00:26:41.405
You’re not turning away?

00:26:41.931 --> 00:26:43.269
Why would I?

00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:55.733
What are you doing?

00:27:04.911 --> 00:27:06.911
Slow down, Doctor.

00:27:08.931 --> 00:27:10.453
I’m a critical care doctor, In.

00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:12.693
I only give strong treatments.

00:27:13.401 --> 00:27:15.221
Maybe it’s a little too strong?

00:27:16.661 --> 00:27:19.061
Mr. Patient, don’t act like
you know better than your doctor.

00:27:19.751 --> 00:27:21.669
Doctor, please don’t push it.

00:27:22.525 --> 00:27:24.521
You just started hitting on me.

00:27:29.111 --> 00:27:30.261
Don’t be naughty.

00:27:36.161 --> 00:27:37.597
Come on. Let’s dry your hair.

00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:31.397
Are you still mad that I fixed the chair?

00:28:34.341 --> 00:28:35.341
No.

00:28:37.141 --> 00:28:38.597
I’m just wondering if…

00:28:38.831 --> 00:28:39.831
If?

00:28:42.581 --> 00:28:45.221
If you can fix everything else
in this house too.

00:28:46.881 --> 00:28:51.421
Feels like we've met somewhere before

00:28:51.445 --> 00:28:55.757
I never did believe in fate or more

00:28:55.797 --> 00:29:01.117
If tomorrow turns out to be the last

00:29:01.161 --> 00:29:08.629
From you I don't wanna be apart

00:29:08.661 --> 00:29:10.709
I'll say I love you

00:29:10.733 --> 00:29:11.589
Let me help.

00:29:11.605 --> 00:29:15.677
A thousand times if you want me to

00:29:15.701 --> 00:29:20.189
Even if someday we drift apart

00:29:20.229 --> 00:29:26.869
It won't matter more than our two hearts

00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:29.133
If I don't get to love you

00:29:29.165 --> 00:29:33.581
Then I'll let it go, don't want anyone new

00:29:33.613 --> 00:29:38.125
What matters is you, baby

00:29:38.157 --> 00:29:46.157
Maybe we were always meant to be

00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:56.965
Thank you.

00:31:34.081 --> 00:31:36.893
Just having the courage
to pick up this guitar today

00:31:38.581 --> 00:31:40.141
is already remarkable.

00:32:04.277 --> 00:32:08.373
At the moment, everyone with ties
to this case is being attacked.

00:32:08.861 --> 00:32:11.325
All they can do with me is threaten.

00:32:12.001 --> 00:32:13.405
It’s strange, though.

00:32:13.429 --> 00:32:15.061
They’ve gone after everyone…

00:32:16.051 --> 00:32:17.629
but not you, Karn.

00:32:21.093 --> 00:32:22.533
I was the first to get into trouble.

00:32:23.451 --> 00:32:25.349
The car that got hit was mine.

00:32:25.381 --> 00:32:27.509
They couldn’t know who was driving, right?

00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:30.653
The stabbing also happened at my condo.

00:32:31.521 --> 00:32:33.149
If you don’t catch the guy soon,

00:32:33.189 --> 00:32:34.357
I won’t last much longer.

00:32:37.741 --> 00:32:39.021
Yeah, that’s true.

00:32:51.221 --> 00:32:52.221
What is it?

00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:54.871
Uh…

00:32:55.481 --> 00:32:59.693
I heard that it’s going to get cooler tonight.

00:33:01.121 --> 00:33:02.645
So I…

00:33:09.521 --> 00:33:11.821
But I have only one extra blanket.

00:33:12.841 --> 00:33:14.333
Then you use it. I’m fine.

00:33:14.357 --> 00:33:15.117
Thap.

00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:16.141
Hm?

00:33:17.241 --> 00:33:19.997
If we’re leaving for Bangkok soon,

00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:23.429
until then…

00:33:27.701 --> 00:33:29.509
can we stay in the same room?

00:33:35.611 --> 00:33:36.611
In.

00:33:38.325 --> 00:33:39.765
I’m worried about you.

00:33:39.805 --> 00:33:42.621
I don’t want to wake up from a dream
and not see you there.

00:33:49.221 --> 00:33:50.773
This time, if I move there…

00:33:53.411 --> 00:33:54.573
I won’t move back.

00:34:18.401 --> 00:34:22.845
I didn’t know you were
such a religious Buddhist.

00:34:24.121 --> 00:34:25.301
Don’t distract me.

00:34:25.891 --> 00:34:27.109
How am I distracting?

00:34:33.111 --> 00:34:34.773
Look, Mr. Inthu.

00:34:35.081 --> 00:34:36.081
Yes?

00:34:37.121 --> 00:34:40.837
You asked the person who just asked you
to be his boyfriend to sleep in the same bed.

00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:42.481
How cruel can you be?

00:34:46.031 --> 00:34:47.031
You don’t like it?

00:34:48.851 --> 00:34:49.965
In…

00:34:55.771 --> 00:34:57.645
Fine, fine.

00:35:08.357 --> 00:35:10.361
Then you must tell me a bedtime story.

00:35:13.031 --> 00:35:14.237
What story?

00:35:15.361 --> 00:35:16.869
Your story.

00:35:19.361 --> 00:35:23.149
Ever since we met, you’ve been the one
who knows everything about me.

00:35:24.161 --> 00:35:25.693
I barely know anything about you.

00:35:27.521 --> 00:35:29.149
I want to know you better.

00:35:32.081 --> 00:35:34.693
I’ve never told anyone my stories.

00:35:44.453 --> 00:35:46.451
Start with the time this house was built.

00:35:52.011 --> 00:35:53.445
This house…

00:35:56.093 --> 00:35:58.091
My dad built it for my mom.

00:35:58.541 --> 00:36:01.189
- Wow.
- Wow, In.

00:36:01.631 --> 00:36:02.853
That was very good.

00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:04.133
You’re good.

00:36:04.157 --> 00:36:05.885
Should I send you
to a competition next year?

00:36:05.909 --> 00:36:08.437
Oh? What competition, Dad?

00:36:09.021 --> 00:36:10.125
What competition?

00:36:10.157 --> 00:36:12.121
The village singing contest on New Year’s.

00:36:12.157 --> 00:36:13.445
There aren’t many contestants.

00:36:13.461 --> 00:36:15.893
Come on.

00:36:17.121 --> 00:36:18.061
You’re really good.

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:20.061
My mom wasn’t very healthy.

00:36:20.481 --> 00:36:22.653
She always saw people’s prophecies.

00:36:23.341 --> 00:36:28.701
Every time she did, she would warn them.

00:36:29.181 --> 00:36:30.805
That made her sick.

00:36:31.269 --> 00:36:34.101
So Dad wanted us to move here,

00:36:35.081 --> 00:36:36.645
hoping she could live a quiet life,

00:36:36.669 --> 00:36:40.165
meet fewer people, and get better.

00:36:43.081 --> 00:36:46.589
Whoa, you’ve grown taller again.

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:48.293
That’s five, six centimeters at least.

00:36:48.881 --> 00:36:51.677
Honey, bring him over for a sandwich.

00:36:51.725 --> 00:36:52.901
Come on.

00:36:53.641 --> 00:36:56.005
- Come over here.
- Let’s go.

00:36:58.853 --> 00:37:00.661
Dance, honey.

00:37:16.949 --> 00:37:18.741
Who would’ve thought that…

00:37:19.637 --> 00:37:21.181
it was my last mark.

00:37:26.171 --> 00:37:27.389
I had a bad dream.

00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:29.109
You and Mom were in an overturned car.

00:37:29.149 --> 00:37:29.669
(In?)

00:37:29.717 --> 00:37:31.671
Don’t drive anywhere just yet.

00:37:33.511 --> 00:37:34.511
(In?)

00:37:36.441 --> 00:37:37.441
(Son!)

00:37:37.871 --> 00:37:38.871
(In!)

00:37:39.901 --> 00:37:40.901
(In.)

00:37:41.741 --> 00:37:42.741
(In!)

00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:48.709
Honey, do you think he’ll be okay?

00:37:48.757 --> 00:37:50.173
Keep calling to check on him.

00:37:50.197 --> 00:37:51.197
Of course.

00:37:53.141 --> 00:37:54.141
Honey, look out!

00:38:15.357 --> 00:38:17.591
Why did you guys leave me alone?

00:38:27.001 --> 00:38:28.629
Up until now,

00:38:29.951 --> 00:38:32.917
I haven’t had the courage
to revisit that flower garden.

00:38:38.121 --> 00:38:39.121
Well?

00:38:39.841 --> 00:38:41.077
How was my story?

00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:45.245
Not fun, right?

00:39:19.561 --> 00:39:24.613
People here told me
if you have a mole right here, you’re unlucky.

00:39:28.351 --> 00:39:30.965
They said it’s the trace of tears
from your past life.

00:39:41.491 --> 00:39:42.491
Not true.

00:39:44.881 --> 00:39:47.189
It’s the mark of my soulmate.

00:39:48.821 --> 00:39:49.949
And from now on,

00:39:51.397 --> 00:39:53.597
there will never be
any trace of tears right here again.

00:40:15.045 --> 00:40:16.045
Thank you…

00:40:18.671 --> 00:40:20.405
for telling me your story.

00:40:32.149 --> 00:40:33.149
In.

00:40:35.721 --> 00:40:37.677
I checked your storage room.

00:40:37.717 --> 00:40:39.533
You’ve got tons of camping gear.

00:40:39.573 --> 00:40:40.861
Let’s camp out today.

00:40:42.961 --> 00:40:44.461
You’re hiding out for your life.

00:40:44.509 --> 00:40:45.509
Okay.

00:40:47.805 --> 00:40:50.045
Then let’s at least watch the stars tonight.

00:40:52.041 --> 00:40:53.041
Thap.

00:40:58.071 --> 00:40:59.341
Where?

00:41:04.109 --> 00:41:05.109
It’s a secret.

00:41:05.641 --> 00:41:06.641
That’s funny.

00:41:06.871 --> 00:41:08.101
This is my house.

00:41:08.511 --> 00:41:09.661
How can it be a secret?

00:41:12.261 --> 00:41:13.261
Deal?

00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:17.991
Mm.

00:41:18.641 --> 00:41:19.641
Thank you.

00:41:33.451 --> 00:41:34.451
Thank you!

00:41:42.941 --> 00:41:44.077
The coffee smells great.

00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:48.909
You’re wearing a blindfold.

00:41:49.141 --> 00:41:50.157
Do I have to?

00:41:50.197 --> 00:41:51.317
It’s a surprise.

00:41:56.251 --> 00:41:57.525
No pranks.

00:41:57.871 --> 00:41:58.871
No pranks.

00:42:11.431 --> 00:42:12.431
Ready?

00:42:53.811 --> 00:42:55.477
(There’s a flower garden?)

00:42:56.081 --> 00:43:01.797
(In’s dad planted it for his wife and son
when In was born.)

00:43:56.081 --> 00:43:57.081
Thap.

00:43:57.551 --> 00:43:58.551
Do you like it?

00:44:04.171 --> 00:44:05.557
How did you know?

00:44:18.469 --> 00:44:20.471
If you like someone enough,

00:44:22.117 --> 00:44:23.117
it’s not that hard.

00:44:44.961 --> 00:44:47.437
We’ll rebuild this house together, In.

00:45:34.161 --> 00:45:38.837
This won’t be the last mark anymore.

00:46:04.301 --> 00:46:05.685
About 180 cm.

00:46:06.901 --> 00:46:07.901
You’ve grown taller.

00:46:37.881 --> 00:46:38.881
And now…

00:46:40.021 --> 00:46:42.021
how about
giving the sunset another chance?

00:46:43.691 --> 00:46:45.109
I think it’s very beautiful.

00:48:26.161 --> 00:48:32.773
The moment you came
And changed my fate’s design

00:48:33.991 --> 00:48:40.501
No star above matched
The beauty in your eyes that shine

00:48:41.681 --> 00:48:47.957
With every smile you gift,
My trembling heart takes flight

00:48:49.173 --> 00:48:55.245
As long as we share the moon,
There’ll be no more lonely nights

00:48:55.277 --> 00:49:03.237
I want to steal and give you
A glowing star from skies above

00:49:03.277 --> 00:49:11.253
Hold you close beneath the moonlight,
Every night whisper love

00:49:11.277 --> 00:49:19.261
The fairest gift of all,
Of anything I’ve ever seen

00:49:19.293 --> 00:49:27.293
Is you by my side,
Watching the moon together and…

00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:34.725
Getting close, embracing you every night

00:49:34.757 --> 00:49:42.621
Wrapping my arms around you,
Holding you tight

00:49:42.661 --> 00:49:50.333
Thank you for walking into my life

00:49:50.365 --> 00:49:54.029
The sky is full of stars

00:49:54.077 --> 00:49:57.077
But none more beautiful…

00:50:00.761 --> 00:50:05.661
Than your eyes are

00:50:30.677 --> 00:50:33.069
You’re amazing, In.

00:50:38.085 --> 00:50:40.081
Thank you so much, Thap,

00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:43.917
for bringing this house to life again.

00:52:47.821 --> 00:52:48.901
Are you sure?

00:52:54.321 --> 00:52:55.485
Aren’t you afraid?

00:53:01.241 --> 00:53:03.317
I know it won’t be easy.

00:53:06.241 --> 00:53:07.989
But I trust you.

00:53:14.681 --> 00:53:21.517
The moment you came
And changed my fate’s design

00:53:21.557 --> 00:53:28.541
No star above matched
The beauty in your eyes that shine

00:53:28.573 --> 00:53:35.421
With every smile you gift,
My trembling heart takes flight

00:53:35.453 --> 00:53:41.453
As long as we share the moon,
There’ll be no more lonely nights

00:53:53.285 --> 00:53:54.285
You okay?

00:54:00.411 --> 00:54:07.245
I want to steal and give you
A glowing star from skies above

00:54:07.261 --> 00:54:14.221
Hold you close beneath the moonlight,
Every night whisper love

00:54:14.245 --> 00:54:21.157
The fairest gift of all,
Of anything I’ve ever seen

00:54:21.189 --> 00:54:28.901
Is you by my side,
Watching the moon together and…

00:54:28.921 --> 00:54:34.981
Getting close, embracing you every night

00:54:35.013 --> 00:54:42.045
Wrapping my arms around you,
Holding you tight

00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:48.629
Thank you for walking into my life

00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:49.813
I love you, In.

00:54:50.871 --> 00:54:52.541
I love you too.

00:54:52.573 --> 00:55:00.397
But none more beautiful
Than your eyes are

00:55:07.141 --> 00:55:09.141
I heard there’s a meteor shower tonight.

00:55:10.061 --> 00:55:12.061
We might see it if we’re lucky.

00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:18.549
They say if you make a wish on one,
it’ll come true.

00:55:26.471 --> 00:55:27.661
Is that it?

00:55:29.301 --> 00:55:30.093
Where?

00:55:30.133 --> 00:55:31.221
It is.

00:56:01.801 --> 00:56:03.325
I thought you didn’t believe in that.

00:56:04.761 --> 00:56:06.645
Hey. I do, sometimes.

00:56:09.491 --> 00:56:10.653
What’s your wish?

00:56:13.717 --> 00:56:15.721
I wish for you to be safe.

00:56:21.291 --> 00:56:23.021
I wish for you to be safe too.

00:56:24.357 --> 00:56:26.361
And I wish for us

00:56:27.141 --> 00:56:28.885
to be happy together for a long time.

00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:34.557
I love you, In.

00:56:37.301 --> 00:56:38.789
I love you too, Thap.

00:57:04.711 --> 00:57:08.053
You two have different religions.

00:57:08.085 --> 00:57:09.733
Is it hard living together?

00:57:09.757 --> 00:57:11.461
When two people live together…

00:57:11.491 --> 00:57:14.149
even if they agree on everything,

00:57:14.181 --> 00:57:16.933
problems can still happen.

00:57:17.237 --> 00:57:18.437
Are you even my boyfriend yet?

00:57:19.301 --> 00:57:21.845
Tell me you’re gonna propose to him.

00:57:21.869 --> 00:57:23.485
I am. On New Year’s night.

00:57:23.517 --> 00:57:26.469
I don’t think Kasidis is acting alone.

00:57:27.181 --> 00:57:28.781
Then deal with him.

00:57:28.813 --> 00:57:29.605
What’s happening?!

00:57:29.629 --> 00:57:30.317
His car went off the mountain!

00:57:30.357 --> 00:57:31.357
Let’s go help them!
