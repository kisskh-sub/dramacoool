00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.920
For the past 10 years, all my efforts

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.400
have focused on changing

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.170
the public's prejudice
against our Zeng family

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.870
so that eventually

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.280
we can enter politics and business

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.140
with an image of loving the people

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.040
and obeying the law.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.400
Therefore,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.020
public opinion is extremely important.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.889

the public's most sensitive nerve

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.630
at the worst possible moment.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.100
"Of all evils, lust is the worst."

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.430
And the victim happened to be

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.160
a young girl from a poor family.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.079
Naturally, this has provoked
public outrage and widespread anger.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.910
What do you think?

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.900
Father, you're right.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.470

I can't control him...

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.030

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.120
So Director Lu asked me to call and see

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.930
if you could come over right away.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:27.590
No problem.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.270
Great.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.200
What's the situation?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.790
We've just admitted this pregnant woman.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.910
Her family says she's been in labor
at home for two days and a night,

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.440
and most of her amniotic fluid
has leaked out.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.360
Why did they wait so long to bring her in?

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.390
The woman came with

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.720
her husband and mother-in-law.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.390
Her mother-in-law is
a traditional midwife,

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.360
and they were planning to
deliver the baby at home.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.410
She was only brought in
because there was no other way.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.940
Okay.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:52.620
Got it.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.980
She needs a C-section.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.430
What?

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.600
How can that be acceptable?

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.720
This is
my daughter-in-law's first pregnancy.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.000
If you cut open her belly,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.550
how will she be able to
have children in the future?

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.080
It won't affect future childbearing.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.550
Is there any other option?

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.880
This is the only option.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:25.860
[Operating Room]

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.320
Doctor,

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.390
how is she?

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.440
The surgery was successful.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.270
You should go home
and bring some necessities.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.080
She should stay hospitalized for a month

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.240
to fully recover.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.640
Then...

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.080
can she still have a second child?

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.840
Enough, Mom.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:48.480
Let's go.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.720
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.780
Thank you, doctor.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.240
Back then, my nanny
couldn't receive proper treatment

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.970
because of backward thinking,

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.560
which is why I later went abroad to study.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.760
I hope I can do my best to prevent

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.790
such tragedies from happening again.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.000
Oh my goodness! What's happening?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
A little hand is coming out!

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.670
Quick! Go get me some salt!

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.150
What do you need salt for?

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.810
Put the salt on that little hand,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.440
and the baby

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.300
will instinctively pull it back.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.630
Mom!

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.680
Don't panic.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.360
This is just normal dizziness
from blood loss during labor.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.150
Go heat up an iron weight
until it's red hot,

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.750
then bring a bowl of vinegar.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.670
Go now.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.430
I want to take my nanny to the hospital.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.430
You silly girl,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.250
what do you know?

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.390
Why don't you trust me?

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.880
I've delivered so many babies.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.330
Let me tell you, in a moment,

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.960
when she takes that red-hot weight,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.390
we'll pour vinegar over it.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.050
Once that smell hits her nose,

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.750
she'll wake up immediately.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:48.700
Give me.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.300
Siyun...

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:03.030
See?

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.490
Isn't she awake now?

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.670
Siyun...

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.280
Take good care of Xiu.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:28.770
Nanny...

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.270
Spirits of heaven and earth.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.080
Nanny!

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.200
Nanny, wake up!

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.710
Nanny, please wake up!

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.790
Nanny!

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.510
Spirits of heaven and earth,

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.960
please bless us.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.160
Please grant us peace and good fortune.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.120
Sorry, I'm late.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.630
I had to perform an emergency surgery.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:01.590
It's alright.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.510
I'm just glad you could make it.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:03.980
Come on.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.060
I thought you might not be able to make it

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.870
because you had to deal with Xiu's matter.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.870
The surgery must have tired you out.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:11.840
Come on, sit.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.200
Thank you.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.500
Would you like some hot water?

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.330
No, thanks.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.270
My parents will be a bit late.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.400
Let's wait for them.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:37.790
Siyun.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.720
I'm really happy.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.670
Happy about what?

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.550
I've always dreamed of marrying a doctor.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.080
I can't believe my dream came true.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:55.390
Siyun?

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.180
You look so beautiful when you blush.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.040
I just read in the newspaper

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.100
that

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.210
you're going to sue Zeng Dalun.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:11.840
Yes.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.820
He's the one who caused Xiu's death.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.030
Then...

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.530
do you know about
the Zeng family's background?

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.340
I know.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.480
Siyun,

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.870
you are a truly

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.090
admirable woman.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.360
Really.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.510
My family is in business

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.790
and has no dealings with them,

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:43.510
but

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.870
if you ever have any problems
in the future,

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.630
I will help you.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.670
I will always

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.400
stand by your side...

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.530
and protect you.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.570
Thank you, Shijun.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.690
You look so beautiful tonight.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.800
Uncle, Aunt.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.080
Mom, Dad.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.380
Siyun, you've grown even more beautiful.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.440
What do you mean, "grown"?

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.510
Siyun has been beautiful
since she was little.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.440
Please sit down.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.020
Let's have dinner.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.750
Siyun.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.000
See?

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.970
My parents and I
share the same aesthetic taste.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.750
Bring the dishes up.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.240
Here, Siyun.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.030
Thank you.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.080
Uncle.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.080
Aunt.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.500
I have a personal matter

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.680
that I'd like to get your advice on.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.160
Go ahead.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:08.099
I want to open a maternity hospital.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.109
And then?

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.880
I studied obstetrics and gynecology
in Germany for 4 years.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:17.970
The country funded my education,

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.670
so I want to give back
by serving the public.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:21.680
Besides,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.400
from a business perspective,

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.790
right now,

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.790
90% of births in our country

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:29.070
are handled by traditional midwives.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.160
But that carries risks.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.530
If we establish

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.680
a highly professional maternity hospital,

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.740
we can help mothers give birth safely

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.070
while providing solid returns
to investors.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.350
Uncle,

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.830
what do you think?

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.840
I think it's an excellent idea.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.880
Write up a proposal,

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:55.970
prepare a budget,

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.200
and I'll take a look.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:57.680
Okay.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.370
I'll help her with it.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.350
Good.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.550
Cheers.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.920
Father wants you to leave.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.850
Leave Shanghai.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.380
Why?

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:27.920
What do you mean, "why"?

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.720
Don't you know what you've done?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.030
I can't defend this case
with a not-guilty plea.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:33.100
In fact,

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.870
this is a case of negligent homicide.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.160
We need the victim's family's forgiveness
and the court's leniency

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.560
to reduce your sentence.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.850
But the plaintiff wants you to
get a severe sentence.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.650
You need to get your luggage ready.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.110
Pack up when you have time.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.300
When should I leave?

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.570
The sooner the better.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.130
Just my darn luck.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.120
I just got back,
and now I have to leave again.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.580
Do you have a place in mind?

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.740
Northeast China.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.420
Why there?

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.750
The latitude there is

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.680
similar to where I studied abroad.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.030
I look good in heavy clothes.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.610
Plus, the situation there is chaotic.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.550
"In times of turmoil, heroes rise."

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.490
Where's the gift I gave you?

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.200
You mean this?

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:16.960
You want it back?

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.160
Well, I'll give you two options too:

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:19.730
one,

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.270
I keep this and go to Northeast China.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.700
Two,

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.420
I return this to you,

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.280
and I go to jail.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.370
Keep your head down once you get there.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.300
No one will protect you there.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.300
I'll miss you.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.790
When I write to you,
remember to write back.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.850
Just don't send me a farewell letter.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.510
Go back and pack up early.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.590
Miss Lin!

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.160
Miss Lin.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.370
You don't need to go to court anymore.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.390
Mr. Zeng has already paid the fine
for Zeng Dalun,

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.310
and Zeng Dalun

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.080
has also left Shanghai.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.490
You arranged this, didn't you?

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.880
Here's the compensation.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.590
Get lost.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.670
None of you Zengs is any good.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.310
Sometimes what you see

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.130
isn't necessarily the truth.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.060
What do you mean?

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.470
The one who killed Xiu

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.610
wasn't Dalun.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.180
Get lost!

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.790
You're an accomplice to murder.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.750
If you ever need help,

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.880
just let me know anytime.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.610
You're not only thick-skinned

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.220
but also shameless.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.160
Siyun.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.030
I asked you out for no particular reason.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.630
I just wanted to chat with you

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800
to cheer you up.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.020
After living and studying in Germany
for 4 years,

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.480
how does it feel to be back?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.750
It's fine.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.450
"Fine"?

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.820
Still putting on a brave face?

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.520
You've been through so much
since you came back,

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.980
and you think I don't know?

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.920
No matter who experienced those things,

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.220
they couldn't possibly feel "fine."

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.550
But Siyun,

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.160
isn't that just how life is?

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.270
Since things have already happened,

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.730
we can't run away from them

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.650
and can only face them bravely.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.750
If there's anything you need my help with,

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:54.920
just say the word.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.370
Anything at all.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.930
You're going to marry Qiao Shijun.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:03.950
That's good.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.860
Wishing you happiness.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.810
Thank you, Shen Yiqun.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.880
I really didn't.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:20.920
You know me.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.240
How could I possibly

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.720
fall for a woman so easily?

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.070
That night, she kept pouring me drinks;

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.200
after baijiu came beer,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.310
and after beer came wine.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.480
I drank way too much.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:30.630
When I woke up the next morning,

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.070
there was breakfast by the bedside.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.750
A few days later,
she claimed she was pregnant.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.610
How am I supposed to believe that?

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.200
That's the whole situation.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.730
Anyway, you have to help me.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.240
How am I supposed to help you?

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.840
Isn't this your usual style?

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.640
Come on, man, don't joke around.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.550
I was completely wasted.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.120
How could I maintain my usual behavior?

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.570
I think this woman is up to something.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.580
It's a trap. She's trying to set me up.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.640
I swear on my honor.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:51.570
You have honor?

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:52.880
Occasionally.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.270
What if she really is pregnant
with your child?

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.000
If she really is pregnant with my child,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
then she's lucky.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.000
I'll support her,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.110
and I'll raise the child.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.750
But do you think that's even possible?

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.510
We only knew each other for one day.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.310
That in just one day,

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.550
a woman would be willing to
have a child for a man she's just met—

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:08.680
it's absurd.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.110
You won't do this for free.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.350
If you can resolve this

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.310
without spending a penny,

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.750
all this money is yours.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.350
I've got another meeting. I gotta go.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.810
Go handle this right away.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:40.860
Hello,

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.050
I'm looking for Director Shen.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:42.960
I have an appointment.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.090
My name is Lin Siyun.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:45.410
I know you.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:46.560
Please come with me.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.700
Hello, Director Shen.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.130
My name is Lin Siyun.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:01.750
Please have a seat.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.700
These are my documents for my application
to open a maternity hospital.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.830
Please review them.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.150
Miss Lin, I hope your hospital

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.910
will be very successful.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.940
Thank you, Director Shen.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.000
When the hospital opens,

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.320
please come with your wife
for the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.720
Okay, certainly.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.200
I'll go with Mr. Qiao then.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:54.380
By the way,

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:55.980
there's one more thing.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.310
My daughter is turning 20,

00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.950
and I'd like to invite you

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.270
and Qiao Shijun to
come to her birthday party.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:04.040
You young people can

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.730
chat and make friends,

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.370
okay?

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:08.660
Okay.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.420
Thank you, Director Shen.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.500
I'll take my leave now.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:13.350
Okay, okay.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:30.200
Hello,

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:31.600
Miss Dai Xi.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:38.290
Who are you?

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.760
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Shen Yiqun

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.090
to have a chat

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.300
with you, Miss Dai.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.160
Tell Shen Yiqun.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.380
My demands are very clear.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.750
He must publish in the newspaper,

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.480
acknowledging me and my child.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.310
He must marry me properly into his family.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.530
I want to be Mrs. Shen.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.640
My child

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.480
must have inheritance rights
to his family fortune.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.570
How much money do you want?

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.260
Are you men all this shameless?

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.520
I don't want money.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:23.890
I want legitimacy.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.000
Guess

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:34.920
why I'm here?

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.710
He can't give you

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.460
the legitimacy you want.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.490
Then I'll see him in court.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.440
If I suffer,

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.780
he won't have it easy either.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.830
When he was pursuing me,

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.510
he was so attentive

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.310
and full of sweet talk.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:05.880
And now?

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.880
Once he got what he wanted, he changed.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.610
He pursued you?

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.040
Yes.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.000
When he was pursuing me,

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.110
he promised to treat me well,

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.270
to take responsibility for me,

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.070
and to marry me.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.110
What did he tell you?

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.870
Pretty much the same as you said.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.340
Sister-in-law,

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.930
have you named the baby yet?

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.920
No. Your brother said

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.830
we should consult the fortune teller
who named Yi.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.560
Where's Yi?

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.590
I haven't seen her anywhere.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.190
Mom took her to the hospital.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.680
Hospital?

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.000
Don't worry.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:24.730
They went to visit a relative,

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.590
you know,

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:26.640
Yi's fiancé.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.680
Wasn't that engagement called off?

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.510
No.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.430
Why not?

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.070
I don't have a say in this matter.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.450
Your brother makes the decisions.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.510
Grandma,

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.500
why are we coming to the hospital?

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:44.510
I'm bringing you to meet

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:46.810
your cousin, whom you've never met before,

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:47.480
Xiong.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.680
What do you mean, "why"?

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.720
He's family.

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.340
Just get to know each other.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.920
Alright.

I'm Yi.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.140
Why are you here?

What illness do you have?

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.890
Have you read Andersen's Fairy Tales?

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:35.240

VSD with moderate tricuspid insufficiency]

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.200
I'm going to die.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.520
Don't say that. You'll be fine.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.580
Father, you wanted to see me?

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.570
Come on, have a seat.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:07.020
The Shen family sent an invitation.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.130
[To Cheng Ao]

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.560
It's for their eldest daughter's

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.490
birthday party.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.490
The Shen family is really
riding high lately.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.960
Their eldest son

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.290
has just been promoted

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.070
to a key position in the government.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.960
They say
it's their daughter's birthday party,

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.490
but it's just an excuse...

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:36.170
to show off.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:40.880
Ao.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.790
You and Shen's eldest son
were classmates in England.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.460
How are you getting along?

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.160
We're on good terms,

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:51.750
but

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:53.750
we don't have much contact professionally.

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:54.550
Why not?

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.240
I don't know
how to deal with politicians like him.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.460
That's a scholar's pretentiousness.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:06.110
When a friend of yours becomes successful,

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.030
you avoid him,

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.640
and that can show your moral superiority?

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.400
No matter how high
an official someone becomes,

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.530
they still need support from friends.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.920
I'm not asking you to
deliberately curry favor with him,

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.030
but there's no need

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.940
to avoid him either, right?

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.420
Ao.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.550
This family...

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:31.070
will be yours to run in the future.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.930
Take the invitation and go.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.530
Rest early, Father.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.800
Bravo! Bravo!

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:30.080
Nan.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:33.310
Siyun.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.960
This is Nan.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.240
You can call her Mrs. Shen,

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.270
or you can just call her Nan

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.110
like I do.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.110
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Shen.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.240
Likewise, Miss Lin.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.750
I've always heard Yiqun mention you,

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.640
and I finally get to meet you today.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.750
I've also heard

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.470
that you want to
open a maternity hospital.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:50.170
Yes.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:51.620
When it opens,

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.900
I'd be honored
if you'd come and cut the ribbon.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.030
I'd be delighted to.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:56.860
But I'm curious.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.660
Why do you want to
open a maternity hospital?

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.130
I'm opening this hospital because

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.480
giving birth in a hospital is

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.220
a luxury many women can't afford.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.030
I want to lower that barrier

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.560
so I can help

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:11.250
more ordinary women in labor.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.250
That's very admirable.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.030
To be honest,

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:16.950
before I got married,

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.110
I always wanted to establish

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.710
a maternity hospital
accessible to all women.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.330
Are you surprised?

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.810
When Nan was in college,

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.510
she was the student council president

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.400
and an activist in student movements.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.040
Protests, strikes, or demonstrations—

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.270
she participated in all of them. Right?

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:37.720
In terms of progressive thinking,

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.680
she's absolutely on par with

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.240
those who studied abroad like you.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.070
It's just a shame

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.200
she married my old-fashioned father.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:44.990
Don't listen to him.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:47.710
Miss Lin, meeting you today,

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:50.440
I feel like I'm seeing my younger self.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.010
I feel that China's new generation

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.610
gives me hope for the future.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:57.070
Thank you
for your encouragement, Mrs. Shen.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.530
I'll certainly do my best.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.440
Excuse me,

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.160
I'm sorry to interrupt,

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.380
but are you sure
this is your first time you've met?

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.920
I feel like you two are

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.150
just like old friends
who've known each other for years.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.480
And you're remarkably similar, you know?

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.920
You're both equally beautiful,

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.190
and your thinking is so perfectly aligned.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:17.590
So I think when you're free,

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.320
you should hang out together,
grab meals, or go shopping.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.840
Also, when you're starting your hospital,

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.130
if there's anything you don't understand,

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:24.300
you can ask Nan.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:25.630
Sure.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:26.960
No problem,

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:27.760
anytime.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:30.790
Alright, I'll leave you young folks.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.739
I still have some things
to take care of downstairs.

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:37.469
Then I'll go give Miss Shen her gift.

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:40.090
She's downstairs. Go ahead.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.110
Miss Shen.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.030
Happy birthday.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.230
Thank you.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.310
Miss Lin, I didn't expect
you would come too.

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:56.710
Have you seen my brother?

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:58.710
Haven't you two been out of contact
for a long time?

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.190
We just ran into each other

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.500
and chatted for a bit.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.550
My brother is such a catch.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.350
You should really consider him.

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:08.780
Never mind.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:11.070
I'm not the type to pressure anyone.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:12.590
Free love, right?

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.070
He's very sought after now.

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:17.480
He's doing really well,

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.230
rising rapidly
through the government ranks.

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:22.360
Miss Shen.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:24.600
Happy birthday.

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:26.730
Qiao Shijun, it's you.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.550
Thank you.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.980
Why don't you two dance?

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.710
I'll go look around over there.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:34.860
Siyun.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.450
Shall we dance?

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.280
Dance with me.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.850
You hate me?

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.360
Some things

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:34.520
that you see

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:36.970
aren't necessarily true.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.400
Marriage is a serious matter.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.040
Are you finished?

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.080
If you want to go,

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.580
you can go anytime.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.630
I'm waiting for you to bring me good news.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.160
Indeed, there's good news.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:39.110
First,

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.630
Dai Xi truly loves you.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:43.460
Second,

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.350
I'm not dealing with this anymore.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:48.910
What exactly did she tell you?

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:51.440
Anyway, it's different from
what you told me.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:55.790
Fine.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:56.760
Buddy,

00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:57.830
I'll be honest.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.840
Dai Xi is now caught up in politics.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.190
I have a political enemy surnamed Liu.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:05.250
You don't know him.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.400
He wants to use Dai Xi
to smear my reputation.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.150
You know me.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:11.830
I never stir up trouble.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:14.430
But this time, trouble came to me.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:17.320
Liu is a despicable man.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.630
Before all this happened,

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.160
I kept my distance from him,

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:22.160
but now that things have unfolded,

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.180
I have no choice but to fight back.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.840
I'm not just going to fight back.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.540
I'm going to defeat him completely,

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.920
making him unable to show his face again.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.960
This is politics.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.090
If you're interested,

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.670
I'll teach you all about it another day.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:33.590
But you have to

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.730
help me settle this matter.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:43.860
We've clinked glasses
but haven't drunk yet!

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:44.390
Brother.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.410
Brother.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.700
Who was that guy dancing with Lin Siyun?

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:49.440
Him?

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.070
He was dancing with Lin Siyun?

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:52.760
Yeah.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:53.400
Who is he?

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:56.640
He's a pillager,

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:57.960
thug,

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:58.960
and murderer.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.970
You'd better not ask about him.

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:03.370
Sounds quite interesting.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.540
What's wrong with you? Interesting?

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.250
You'd better stay...

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.650
You'd better stay away from him.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:11.450
Do you hear me?

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.400
I like dancing with a pillager.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.400
I just saw Mayor Wang

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.440
come with his son.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.220
Go dance with Mayor Wang's son.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.020
Go on, be a good girl.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:22.830
I won't!

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:25.320
It's my birthday. Can't I speak my mind?

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.400
Since you love dancing so much,
go dance with Mayor Wang's son then.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.230
Hey, you... your brat...

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:29.690
Don't keep pointing at me!

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.180
You're back, Siyun.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.280
How was it?

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.590
Did you enjoy the party?

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.130
Let me show you something good.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.030
A written IOU.

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:55.030
[IOU]

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:57.510
The Qiao family promised

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.910
that after your wedding,

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.120
they'll help me settle all my debts.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.490
I really...

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.150
I really thank you for this.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.600
I really mean it—sincerely,

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.410
genuinely,

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.160
from the bottom of my heart.

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:17.770
You single-handedly

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.480
saved our Lin family.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:21.440
But from today on,

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.210
you need to start going to bed
and waking up early.

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:23.980
Go jogging,

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.360
exercise,

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.820
and strengthen your body.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.140
You mustn't fall ill before the wedding.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:32.980
Mom.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.280
What's going on with Yi's marriage?

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.400
What era is this,
and you're still arranging her marriage?

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.460
What will people say if this gets out?

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.280
It'll affect Yi too.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.580
How is she supposed to make friends?

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.450
Regarding Yi's marriage...

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:51.050
I don't have the final say.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.560
Whatever your brother says

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.480
is what we'll do.

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:00.280
Mom.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.190
If it's inconvenient for you to handle it,

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.800
I'll go to the Zhu family myself.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.050
No, no, no need.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.380
I'll handle it.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:10.570
We completely respect you.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:12.170
Whatever you disapprove of,

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.560
we won't do.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.790
Tomorrow, I'll go talk to Madam Zhu.

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:19.730
And we won't take no for an answer.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.070
Now, if anyone tries to pick on

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.400
our Lin family,

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.110
I won't stand for it.
