00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
My parents want me to marry their friend’s son.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.760
Can you give my mom a false reading?

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.320
Can you read Thap’s fortune?

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.760
You know I don’t like fortune-telling.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.360
I don’t like it, and I don’t believe in it.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.240
Your work will bring misfortune.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.240
And you’ll fall into danger.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.400
Life-threatening danger.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.080
Sprained your wrist from shuffling too hard?

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.920
In!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.640
In!

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.600
Dad, I had a bad dream.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.440
You and Mom were in an overturned car.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.080
Please don’t drive anywhere just yet.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.200
In.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.120
Thap, how’s he doing?

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.440
Inflamed wrist tendons.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.480
The doctor had him admitted for one night since he has a history of fainting,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.800
worried he might hit his head and suffer brain damage.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.920
Oh no, In...

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.280
Will you believe what he said about you now?

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.560
He got injured because he helped you.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.840
What did he say?

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.680
He said Thap’s misfortune could cost him his life.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.880
Then…

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.320
those falling metal pieces—

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.080
What?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.480
Thap!

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.440
Don’t.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.400
Don’t tell Mom and Dad about this, okay?

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.440
And instead of getting mad at me,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.320
you should call your friend’s relatives.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.680
Tell them to come take care of him.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.840
He doesn’t have any relatives.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.680
I’m the only one he has.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.080
In.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.040
Thap!

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.320
Did you call the police?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.160
Call the police?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.480
Thap, what’s going on exactly?

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.920
You two, talk to me outside.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.400
Dao, stay here.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.040
Come on!

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.760
How are you?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.360
The one who’s really hurt isn’t Thap.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.040
It’s the guy who helped him.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.360
If this wasn’t an accident,

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.000
then someone really wanted you dead.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.280
I think…

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.200
Kasidis knows you’re onto him.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.720
How would he know?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.680
Can’t we just get an arrest warrant?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.200
Not enough evidence.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.400
So Thap’s in danger,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.560
and we can’t do anything?

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.280
I’m okay now.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.480
But I’m more worried about my family.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.520
If they find out about this,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.560
they’ll freaking lose their minds.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.520
If you’re worried about them,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.920
why not come stay at my condo for a while?

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.000
It’s closer to the hospital.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.040
Besides, it’d be safer if we lived together.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.480
Thanks, Karn.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.160
But I’ll pass for now.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.800
Let’s wait until it’s absolutely necessary.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.200
It is necessary.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.960
I know. Thanks.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.240
Anyway, I’ve got a question about something.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.480
What?

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.240
Between you two…

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.440
Is something going on?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.720
The vibe feels off.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.560
No.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.840
Nothing.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.960
Surprised I remember you?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.760
A little.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.920
Why did you pretend you didn’t recognize me?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.640
Because I wasn’t sure if you remembered me....

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.320
or maybe…

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.040
you didn’t want to.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.120
Ouch.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.040
Please help Thap.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400
I’m really worried about him.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.840
Let me know if there’s anything I can do.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.360
Sure. Don’t worry.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.080
It’s my job.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.680
Congrats on becoming a cop.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.560
Back when we were kids,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.760
I said I wanted to be a cop,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.080
and you said you wanted to be a doctor.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.320
It sounded so boring.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.600
No job’s really exciting.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.240
I only said that to please the teacher.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.720
Still, I’m happy.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.520
That I became a doctor?

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.320
That I got to see you.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.040
Bye.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
If you’re already awake, just open your eyes.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.240
From the look on your face, I don’t think I need to ask how much you remember.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.080
Ow.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.080
Ouch!

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.840
Your wrist tendons are seriously inflamed.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.040
Be careful.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.920
So…

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.400
What do you remember?

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.080
I don’t even want to remember anything.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.000
Good.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.000
Good answer.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.200
Hearing that puts me at ease.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.720
In!

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.000
In!

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.920
Hey.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.080
Can you remember anything?

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.320
The doctor said you have a concussion.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.240
Miss, who are you?

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.920
Thap.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.760
Are you the one who called your big brother foul-mouthed?

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.080
Damn it, In!

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.440
Why’d you have to scare me like that?

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.360
Ouch, Dao.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.120
It hurts.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.040
Just shut up!

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.160
What’s wrong with you?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.360
I’m going to hit you.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.720
Dao.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.680
I’m off to work.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.480
If he shows any strange symptoms, call me.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.680
Okay?

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.400
Mm.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.640
Oh, I’m not going home tonight.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.320
I told Mom I’d stay here with In.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.640
Mm.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.320
Hey, thank you so much for helping my brother.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.840
Come on, it’s alright.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.400
Is your brother okay, though?

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.520
He’s okay today.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.960
But it’s been crazy lately.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.640
What should I do, In?

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.960
Thap just started talking to Dad again.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.640
If something happened to him,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.280
my family would definitely fall apart.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.920
What…

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.880
It’s time for your meds.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.520
May I check your temperature, please?

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.640
Your work will bring misfortune.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.640
And you’ll fall into danger.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.880
Life-threatening danger.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.800
Hello.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.360
Start CPR. I’m on my way.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.040
Over the past hour, her CVP has been elevated.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.680
Now her BP is starting to drop.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.040
What about her ACT after adjusting the Heparin?

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.600
Still high. We’re working on lowering it.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.840
Get an Echo right away.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.200
It’s likely a pericardial effusion.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:21.800
Yes.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.880
Echo, please.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.200
Prep for pericardiocentesis.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.000
Yes, Doctor.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.120
Doctor, how is she?

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.200
There was excess bloody fluid in her pericardial cavity,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.200
caused by the blood thinner.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.400
But I’ve removed it,

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.040
so there’s no need to worry.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.360
Well, she’s under Dr. Thap’s care. I have nothing to worry about.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.480
Thank you, sir.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.600
I’m not the kind of doctor who gives people hope lightly.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.800
But for you, Mr. Kasidis,

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.440
I really want to say this.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.200
You can hope she’ll make it.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.640
This hospital has such a competent, smart,

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.680
and hard-working doctor.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.760
I’m not worried at all.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.000
Anyway, take care of your own health too.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.960
Thank you.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.840
What the?

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.080
Holy shit.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.040
What the hell is this?

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.480
Mom.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.800
Dad.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.520
Mom.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.320
Oh, please.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.560
Dao left.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.680
She told me to take over.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.280
Aren’t there any nurses in this hospital?

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.960
Just lie down. I’ll do it.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.360
Later this morning,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.800
my police friend will come talk to you.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.000
Is that okay?

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.560
Can I say no?

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.200
Just asking out of courtesy.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.960
Where are you going now?

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.080
Bathroom.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.840
Don’t help.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.160
I can manage on my own.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.960
“Don’t help.”

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.920
“I can manage on my own.”

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.640
Move.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.160
Well, close the door.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.000
I put the toothpaste on the brush for you.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.720
If you want to wipe, there’s a towel next to it.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.960
But if you can’t, just let me know.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.920
Are you crazy?

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.800
Who would do that?

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.920
I meant I’d call a nurse for you.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.360
What are you thinking?

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.760
Doctor Asshole.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.240
You said you dream about near-future events.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.200
Did you see in your dream whether it was an accident or intentional?

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.360
No.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.480
I checked the scene.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.560
No brake marks.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.600
And the car was speeding.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.680
The culprit definitely targeted Dr. Thap.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.040
That includes your punctured tires last night.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.280
This guy really knows what he’s doing.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.640
He knows the camera angles.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.880
Now, you.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.280
Me?

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.600
What about me?

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.280
Why on earth did you park in a blind spot?

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.320
A doctor is supposed to be smart.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.200
He’s so possessive of his car.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.320
When he parks,

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.960
he leaves plenty of space next to him.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.280
He’s afraid someone might open their door and hit his car.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.000
And what’s the result?

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.160
Flat tires.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.120
Serves you right.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.520
Those tires are rare.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.040
How long will it take to get a new set?

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.360
Are you guys really my friends?

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.360
Of course we are.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.560
Hey, we’re serious.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.400
It’s back-to-back attacks.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.400
You should come stay at my place.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.160
Yeah. Dr. Karn’s place is closest to the hospital.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.280
At least you’ll minimize the risk on your way to work.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.440
Excuse me.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.160
If you’re done with me, can you please continue your conversation outside?

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.680
I’d like to rest.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.360
How about a meal?

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.040
I have surgery to get to. Sorry.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.920
Okay, I’ll get going then.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.080
Bye.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.200
See you.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.000
See you.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.760
Looks like you’re destined to date someone in uniform.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:50.960
Shut up.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.800
Is your wrist still hurting?

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.240
No.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.680
I’ll lower the painkiller dosage then.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.760
Wait. It still hurts…

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.320
a little.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.800
Any headache? Nausea?

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.160
No.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.000
So…

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.920
Did you sleep well last night?

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.040
Sort of.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.160
Can I be discharged now?

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.080
I’d say stay one more night.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.600
Your fever hasn’t gone down yet.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.000
Mhm.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.440
It’s not like there’s anyone at home to take care of you, is it?

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.760
Then discharge me.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.800
Because I can take care of myself.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.160
Mom.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.880
Is it okay if I stay at Karn’s place for a while?

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.880
Why?

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.600
There are a lot of ICU cases.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.960
The workload is insane.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.880
So I really need to stay nearby.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.400
Where’s your car, Thap?

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.080
At the service center.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.360
What happened to it?

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.240
Uh…

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.040
I already told Mom everything, Thap.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.560
Dao.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.600
You were nearly hit by falling metal,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.440
hit by a car,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.040
and had your tires punctured.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.000
Thap, when were you planning to tell me?

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.720
I forbid you from leaving this house until they catch whoever’s behind this.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.720
Mom!

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.600
I have work to do.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.960
Is your job more important than me?

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.600
Of course not.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.360
That’s why I’m telling you I need to stay at Karn’s for now.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.360
And what good does that do?

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.280
Your dad is also worried about you.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.320
Why should we be?

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.040
Thap’s the eldest.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.840
He can handle something this small on his own.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.360
Mom.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.240
Listen to me.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.080
Karn’s place is very close to the hospital.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.640
I promise I won’t go anywhere but my workplace and there.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.280
Besides, my police friend Ton is looking into this case.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.240
Don’t worry.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.920
Then I want an update every hour on wherever you are. Understand?

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.400
I understand.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.560
And whatever happens, you tell me.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.800
I’m sorry, Mom.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.720
Sorry.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.040
Did you get hurt?

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.600
Make yourself at home.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.560
That’s your room.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.000
The guestroom.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.720
Yeah. Thanks.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.720
As for a new car, you can use mine.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.560
I think it’ll be a while before yours gets fixed.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.920
No, it’s okay.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.160
I can just take a taxi.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.200
It’s fine. Take it.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.680
Why bother with taxis?

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.600
Thap.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.680
Hm?

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.880
Are you sure Kasidis is behind everything that’s happened to you?

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.800
If it’s not Kasidis,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.040
then I don’t know who else it could be.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.360
Ever since Mrs. Tara’s case, all kinds of things have been happening to me.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.880
Bright side.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.000
You got through it all.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.840
So, what about the management position my uncle asked you to help with?

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.840
Karn, why don’t you let me survive this first?

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.080
Don’t talk like you’re about to die.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.320
You have to survive.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.320
The deputy director position is waiting for you.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.760
My brother said you shouldn’t leave the hospital yet.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.440
You should stay a bit longer.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.520
Why would I stay?

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.360
There’s so much to do.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.400
Besides, I have to go to Mae Hong Son soon.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.640
Fine.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.520
Just don’t faint on me.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.000
I can’t carry you.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.680
Dao.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.960
Are you okay?

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.920
I’m worried about Thap.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.520
I don’t know what other doomed fate lies ahead for him.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.000
Now he’s staying at his friend’s place.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.040
That worries me even more.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.880
Don’t worry.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.680
Your brother’s fate is doomed

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.440
every time he opens his mouth anyway.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.640
You should worry about someone else.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.560
Is that what your cards told you, or simply your opinion?

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.600
When was he here?

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.040
I was about to tell you.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.600
I brought my brother his stuff.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.040
Hold on.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:46.920
Here.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.560
Tell Mom she doesn’t have to worry, okay?

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.040
You should call and tell her yourself, Thap.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.280
Let’s go, In.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.920
Hey, are you alright?

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.000
I’m fine.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.600
You’re burning up.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.320
I’m okay.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.440
I think you should stop by the hospital.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:19.920
No need.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.800
Hey, aren’t you going to cooperate with anyone?

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.000
It doesn’t concern you.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.600
- Hey. - In.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.120
Give me your stuff.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.880
I’ll leave your graduation gown with someone.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.680
Thap, please take him to the hospital.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.800
His car’s parked outside.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.440
Mm.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.320
Please.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.360
Where’s your car?

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.240
I think you’re on a streak of bad luck.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.040
You keep ending up in the hospital.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.480
Yeah, I’m unlucky because I met you.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.520
I’ll handle this case.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.320
Of course.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.320
Can I get a different doctor?

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.080
Lost your argument power once you saw the needle?

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:39.760
Hm?

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.640
Relax.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.720
The doctor’s very gentle. Don’t be afraid.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.920
All done.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.600
I gave you a fever reducer and some anti-anxiety meds.

00:29:16.636 --> 00:29:18.080
You should start feeling drowsy soon.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.600
You can sleep and get some rest.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.840
But I have things to do.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.040
Wait until the saline’s done.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.040
Don’t be stubborn.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.920
I’ll be right here, not bothering you. Okay?

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.000
40 minutes. Be patient.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.200
Doctor…

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.640
The saline is finished.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.560
Stay still. It’s your doctor.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.320
You okay?

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:56.920
Mm.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.480
I’ll drive you home.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.400
Wait in the car.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.680
I’ll be right back.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.600
What?

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.040
Wait. Wait.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.920
Can I see your hand?

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.120
Why?

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.040
You’re bleeding.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.840
Who walks around with Band-Aids?

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.440
Doctors do.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.000
May I?

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.160
The orthopedist advised eating enough protein

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.160
so your wrist can recover quickly.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.560
Here. Some candy.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.720
So you won’t faint again.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.760
I’ll be leaving now.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.880
My ride is here.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.440
Wait.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.160
Hm?

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.320
Thank you.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.840
But next time, don’t bother.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.400
Thank you too for helping me.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.000
But next time, don’t.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.680
It’s too risky.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.360
How is your patient?

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.600
So there really are no secrets in this hospital, huh?

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.320
Well, you personally gave him the injection and watched over him.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.280
Critical case?

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.200
No.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.520
Just what I’m talking about.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.720
I heard you even drove him home.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.560
Are you hitting on him?

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.400
Hitting on him, my ass!

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.840
I just felt bad. His injury was my fault.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.040
If you’re not hitting on him,

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.000
then I’ll make a move.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.920
You’re so damn tight-lipped.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.640
Hello?

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.480
Alright. I’ll be there.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.040
The hospital?

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.360
Yeah. I’m heading out.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.960
Thap! Hey!

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.680
Car key.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.480
Thanks.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.080
See you.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:06.920
Yeah.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.560
No!

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.360
(Yes, Mom?)

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.680
(What?)

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.560
(Thap was in a car accident?)

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.960
(Sure. I’m heading to the hospital now.)

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.680
EMERGENCY ROOM

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.920
I think you should disappear for a while.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.800
Ton.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.680
I already moved in with Karn like you asked.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.480
Where else can I go to make you happy?

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.200
Mae Hong Son.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.440
Why Mae Hong Son?

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.840
In goes there every year.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.920
And every time, it’s like he vanishes

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.640
because his house is up in the mountains.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.520
No signals. No people.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.360
So I figured…

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.880
Good idea. I’m on board.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.720
But I’m not.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.360
Honey.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.360
Hey.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.240
How about this, Thap?

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.000
Wrap up everything with your current patients,

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.800
then spread a rumor that you’re attending a seminar or going abroad for a month.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.720
We’ll figure out where you actually go later.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.160
Sorry, sir.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.440
Dao.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.760
Where’s your brother?

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.320
Answer the phone, Thap.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.400
Come on.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.200
Thap, answer.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.120
Yes, Dao?

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.560
Thap, where are you?

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.800
In a taxi.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.840
Heading back to Karn’s place.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.760
Thap, listen to me.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.600
In dreamed that you were stabbed in the elevator at Karn’s condo.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.960
He should be there already.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.440
Sir, you can’t go inside!

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.840
Are you a resident here?

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.360
Sorry, ma’am.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.920
Can you please open Room 806 for me?

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.440
No.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.880
I need to get up there right now!

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.920
If you’re not a resident,

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.280
you’ll have to wait for the room owner.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.360
Ma’am, he’s in danger.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.880
- Open the door for me. - I can’t, not unless you’re a resident.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.440
If you don’t, he could die!

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.640
Guard!

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.200
Please, I’m begging you.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:47.960
Open the door.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:48.320
I can’t.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.040
Please. I have to go up there now.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.720
Okay then.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.120
But we’re coming with you.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.680
This way, please.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.280
Your work will bring misfortune.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.880
And you’ll fall into danger.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.920
Life-threatening danger.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.840
If this wasn’t an accident,

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.400
then someone really wanted you dead.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.440
The culprit definitely targeted Dr. Thap.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.360
Sir, no change.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.280
Hey!

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.040
- Sir, please lower your voice. - Open the door!

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:42.720
Hey!

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.040
Sir, quiet down.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.280
- Hey, doc! - There might be no one inside.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.080
Sir, please stop.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.040
Hey! Open the door!

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.160
Sir!

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.720
Please wait downstairs.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.720
You’re disturbing the other residents.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.520
Take him down. I’ll speak with the residents.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.400
Come with me.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.960
I’m so sorry.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.160
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:08.880
Sir, please.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.600
Why did you say someone would die?

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.440
Where did you hear that from?

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.440
Once the elevator opens, walk with me to the car.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.040
No funny business.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:57.840
Stop!

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.760
Catch him!

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:21.760
Give me your car key.

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.040
Leave me alone.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.040
Will you stop being stubborn?

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.640
Hand over the car key.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.160
What are you doing?

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.680
Give me the key!

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.120
Calm down.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.280
Take a deep breath.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.840
Deep breath.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.080
I’m going home.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.440
Hey!

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.640
Will it kill you to just listen to me once?

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.880
And honestly, why did you come to help me?

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.640
You risked all this for your stupid dream?

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.520
Did it really happen though?

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.880
Didn’t you see it?

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.480
Why did you come?

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.480
Whatever happens to me, let it.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.040
It’s not something you should risk your life for.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.840
And just let you die?

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.680
Yes. Let me die.

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.720
Then why did you help me when I was sick?

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.280
Because I’m a doctor.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.840
So only doctors have that honor?

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.640
You can do whatever damn thing you want, and it’s fine

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.200
I’m just a fortuneteller,

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.040
so I’m the one butting in, right?

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.360
You get to save lives when people are sick.

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.080
But when I see death coming, I can’t do anything.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.360
Honey, look out!

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.040
Take it easy.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.120
I didn’t mean it like that.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.480
You’re so damn selfish.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.080
Do you know how worried your family is?

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.920
And what do you want me to do?

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.480
Run away?

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.040
Run like everyone else tells me?

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.920
Why?

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.400
What did I do wrong?

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.720
I’m just a doctor.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.040
My job is to treat patients.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.040
Why does a doctor who helps people and does the right thing have to run away?

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.400
And what did I do wrong…

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.160
to lose my parents?

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.640
Would it hurt so damn much to just get lost for a little while?

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.600
You only see things from your side.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.640
Have you ever thought about

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.360
how devastated your parents and Dao would be if something happened to you?

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.480
Have you ever thought about those who have to keep living?

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.200
For those who die, it’s over.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.840
But for those who live...

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.920
it’s not freaking easy

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.680
to get through each day. Do you know that?

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.640
Come on. Let’s get you home.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:18.440
Go home.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.400
Let go.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.680
- Hey. - Let go!

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.000
- Go home. - Let go!

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.160
Come on.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.040
Don’t!

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.320
I said don’t.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.200
Let’s get home.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.960
I’m sorry!

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.000
I’m sorry!

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.960
Why are you stopping?

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.480
You want to help me, don’t you?

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.360
I don’t want to help you.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.480
But you don’t want Dao to be sad.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.840
I’m not saying I believe you.

00:47:54.840 --> 00:48:00.120
But if I agree to lay low for a while,

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.480
would that be okay?

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.000
That’s your business.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.480
It’s your business too.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.360
How’s that?

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.240
I’ll do what you warned me about.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.720
So you have to take responsibility.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.680
I really want to know how I ended up in your dream.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.000
I’m coming to Mae Hong Son with you.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.320
Don’t fall for him.

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.000
What are you even talking about?

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.280
Are you two a couple?

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.560
You’re on the run, not on vacation.

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.920
Make yourself comfortable.

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.400
And no association needed.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.320
Ouch!

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.440
Why is the bathroom floor soaking wet?

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.160
It’s called a bathroom for a reason.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:26.480
I’ve decided to let you do all the work to pay off the rent.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.720
Is this a sanctuary or a sweatshop?

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.680
You told me to make myself comfortable.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.640
Not that comfortable.

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.000
Wait.
