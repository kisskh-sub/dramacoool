00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.196
You might need to
come back to Bangkok sooner.

00:00:02.228 --> 00:00:03.644
If it’s not about work,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.164
I don’t want to leave at all, you know?

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.068
Why do you want a reading all of a sudden?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.804
I want to know if I’ve found my soulmate yet.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.820
You have.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.764
I have?

00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:14.676
Someone’s threatening me
to stop working on my case.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.828
If you keep going, I’m with you.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.268
The courage to pick up this guitar today
is already remarkable.

00:00:24.036 --> 00:00:26.040
We will rebuild this house together.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.316
Thank you so much, Thap,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.220
for bringing this house to life again.

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:40.300
The youngsters are looking.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.828
How much rice do you want?

00:00:44.436 --> 00:00:45.596
One sack.

00:00:45.964 --> 00:00:47.580
One plate is enough.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.564
Uncle Ju, Auntie Pian.

00:00:50.604 --> 00:00:50.996
Yes?

00:00:51.028 --> 00:00:53.988
May I ask you something?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.716
- Of course.
- Sure.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.604
Since you two have different religions,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.420
is it hard to live together?

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.100
Well, when two people live together,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.292
even if they share the exact same beliefs,

00:01:13.308 --> 00:01:16.276
problems can still happen.

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:16.860
Right?

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.900
Mm.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.276
There’s a verse in the Bible that says,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.116
“And now these three remain:

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.716
faith, hope, and love.”

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.620
That sounds so familiar.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.380
I think I heard it back in school.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.876
Do you remember the next part?

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.388
“And now these three remain:
faith, hope, and love.”

00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:50.420
“But the greatest of these is love.”

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.012
But the greatest of these is love!

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.916
That’s right. Very good.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.860
Come on. Let’s eat.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.116
Will you stop?

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.996
What are you saying?

00:02:31.092 --> 00:02:32.420
So sweet.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So sweet?

00:02:36.292 --> 00:02:37.660
Isn’t it supposed to be ‘so good’?

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.268
Morning, In.

00:03:18.812 --> 00:03:20.300
Morning, Thap.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.430
Did you have a good dream last night?

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.732
You can just sleep in.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.076
I’ll go make us breakfast.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.050
Okay?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.588
I’m not hungry yet.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.740
In.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.220
Hm?

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.412
Can I be hungry then?

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.692
Didn’t you have enough last night, Doctor?

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.436
Being a doctor takes a lot of energy, Patient.

00:04:40.452 --> 00:04:41.452
Thap!

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.420
Take it easy, Doctor.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.004
Here, let me help.

00:05:05.012 --> 00:05:06.228
It’s alright, In.

00:05:06.284 --> 00:05:08.230
I’ve got it. You should rest a bit.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.556
I feel like I’m making you do everything.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.228
Didn’t you say back when we first came

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.540
that I’d handle the housework
to cover the rent and your injury?

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.500
Yeah, but it’s different now.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.236
Different how?

00:05:36.548 --> 00:05:37.700
Do tell.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.268
Well…

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.300
Help!

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.300
Help!

00:05:42.516 --> 00:05:43.516
Help!

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320
Help!

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.348
What’s happening?

00:07:20.372 --> 00:07:21.300
The chief’s car went off the mountain.

00:07:21.324 --> 00:07:22.588
Let’s go help.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.260
In, pull yourself together and follow me.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.150
Help!

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.444
Have you called an ambulance?

00:07:53.468 --> 00:07:54.676
Yes, I did.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.880
Don’t!

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.900
Let me check the casualty.

00:07:58.924 --> 00:07:59.732
You can’t.

00:07:59.772 --> 00:08:01.212
Come on. I’m a doctor!

00:08:01.236 --> 00:08:01.884
You can’t get through.

00:08:01.916 --> 00:08:03.196
Sir, listen to me!

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.180
I’m a doctor!

00:08:04.204 --> 00:08:05.284
He really is a doctor.

00:08:05.316 --> 00:08:06.196
Are you really a doctor?

00:08:06.228 --> 00:08:07.244
- I really am.
- He is.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.500
Let me through.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.196
Let him through.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.220
Let me through.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:11.996
Let him through.

00:08:12.036 --> 00:08:12.868
Let him. Quick!

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.030
Now!

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.030
Chief.

00:08:19.092 --> 00:08:21.188
Chief! Chief!

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.436
Help… Khaohom.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.020
Help her.

00:08:28.044 --> 00:08:29.124
Khaohom’s in the truck too.

00:08:29.164 --> 00:08:30.164
Help me find her!

00:08:30.188 --> 00:08:31.804
Somebody, get Uncle Ju out.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.204
Bro, get the Chief out of the car!

00:08:36.228 --> 00:08:38.012
There’s smoke. Now!

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.604
Khaohom.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.324
Khaohom!

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.812
In, help me here.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.130
Khaohom.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.410
Khaohom.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.850
Khaohom.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Khaohom!

00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:00.204
Khaohom!

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.692
You get to save lives when people are sick.

00:09:03.732 --> 00:09:06.468
But when I see death coming,
I can’t do anything.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.092
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.780
Don’t move. In, let me take over.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.960
Auntie Pian,

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.188
Khaohom is going to be fine.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.980
Uncle Ju as well.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.812
The patient’s oxygen level is dropping.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.772
Give me a stethoscope.

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:48.796
Yes, sir.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.572
Breath sounds are reduced on the right.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.548
It’s tension pneumothorax.

00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:05.028
Prepare for needle decompression.

00:10:05.052 --> 00:10:06.156
In the ambulance, Doctor?

00:10:06.188 --> 00:10:07.516
The patient can’t wait.

00:10:07.556 --> 00:10:08.556
Understood.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.636
Alcohol, please.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.020
Here.

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:21.516
Be careful, Doctor.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.620
Oxygen level’s improving.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.124
How are Uncle Ju and Khaohom?

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.892
They’re both safe now.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.076
Uncle Ju is in surgery.

00:10:56.108 --> 00:10:58.532
Khaohom has a cut on her leg.

00:10:58.556 --> 00:10:59.644
She’s getting stitches.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.640
In.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.692
Don’t worry. They’re going to be fine.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.020
I think…

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.972
if we’re waiting for Uncle Ju
and Khaohom here, we should change.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.204
There’s a flea market nearby.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.580
I’ve changed my mind.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.068
Oh, come on.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.508
Let’s go, In.

00:11:58.532 --> 00:12:00.510
Uncle Ju and Khaohom are safe.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:03.836
But you’re not.

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:09.270
I promise I’ll take care of myself.

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:23.908
What?

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.040
You don’t like people holding your hand?

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.040
It’s not that.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.244
It’s just no one’s held my hand in a long time.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.124
I’m holding it now.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.644
And I’ll hold it forever.

00:12:47.876 --> 00:12:48.876
Let’s go.

00:13:00.892 --> 00:13:01.892
Mm.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.612
Then finish him off.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.830
Thap.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.572
Can I stop by this shop?

00:13:19.588 --> 00:13:20.836
Mm, sure.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.540
Hi.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:30.690
Hi.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.280
You like it?

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.948
“Protects you
and keeps you safe from danger.”

00:13:43.732 --> 00:13:45.730
I’ll take this one.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.420
Okay. QR?

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.870
Yeah, sure.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.044
Give me your hand.

00:13:58.068 --> 00:13:59.068
Hm?

00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:01.924
Here.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.444
I bought it for you.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.388
So you’ll be safe.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.370
Thank you.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.500
This is Moonstone.
It brings out positive energy.

00:14:20.532 --> 00:14:22.828
It also brings happiness and good luck.

00:14:29.484 --> 00:14:31.480
Are you Doctor Thapfah?

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:35.732
I am.

00:14:35.748 --> 00:14:40.588
The whole village is talking about the doctor
from Bangkok who helped Uncle Ju.

00:14:40.628 --> 00:14:42.876
Can we take a picture with you?

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.060
With me?

00:14:45.276 --> 00:14:46.836
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:14:50.092 --> 00:14:51.092
Sure.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.244
This way, please, Doctor.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.212
Right there?

00:14:53.236 --> 00:14:54.236
Yes.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.580
Uh… thank you.

00:15:01.612 --> 00:15:02.612
Thank you.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.836
Thank you.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:08.860
Sure, thank you.

00:15:22.884 --> 00:15:25.780
Whoa, Auntie Pian.

00:15:25.828 --> 00:15:27.636
What are these?

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.640
I want to thank Thap

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.332
for helping Ju and Khaohom.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.292
I wouldn’t know what I’d do
if anything happened to them.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.884
Antie Pian, it’s nothing.

00:15:44.916 --> 00:15:47.460
It’s my job to do that.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.500
I’m so glad you’re part of Phu Dao village.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.196
In, you too, dear.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.460
Not just Ju and me,

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.220
but the whole village
loves you both so much.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.932
Just like we loved your parents, In.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:30.796
I just wanted to thank you in person.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.076
Thank you, Thap.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.692
It’s my pleasure.

00:16:36.724 --> 00:16:38.720
Are you visiting Khaohom today?

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.684
I am, in the evening.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.700
I’ve been busy with
the New Year’s party preparation.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.500
Since Ju was in the hospital,

00:16:47.532 --> 00:16:49.868
things have been hectic.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.500
So…

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.140
Thap and In,

00:16:57.108 --> 00:16:59.110
aren’t you staying a little longer?

00:17:09.916 --> 00:17:10.916
Ton.

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:13.212
Good thing you called.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.828
We arrested the guy
who killed Mrs. Tara’s parents.

00:17:16.868 --> 00:17:18.376
He’s being brought in for interrogation.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.400
Who is it?

00:17:19.628 --> 00:17:21.444
Just a henchman, not the real boss.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.004
But if he confesses, it’s done.

00:17:23.028 --> 00:17:24.508
We can get the arrest warrant issued.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.132
Anyway…

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.300
when are you coming back?

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.756
Can I stay a little longer?

00:17:31.988 --> 00:17:33.636
Gosh, Doc.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.228
Tell me you’re going to propose to him.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.892
Propose, my ass.

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:40.532
I’m asking him to be my boyfriend.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.116
Hurry up and bring him back.

00:17:45.156 --> 00:17:47.180
I’m doing that on New Year’s night.

00:17:47.204 --> 00:17:48.628
Once it’s done,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.804
I’m taking him back right away.

00:17:49.828 --> 00:17:50.828
Okay?

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.996
Yeah, just make it quick.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.280
How’s the interrogation going?

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.436
I’ve used almost every detective I have
on this case alone.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.292
The bastard who murdered
Mrs. Tara’s parents won’t say who ordered it.

00:18:13.316 --> 00:18:15.106
I don’t know what’s blocking his damn tongue.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.252
What about the prescription?

00:18:16.268 --> 00:18:18.540
It could count as evidence,

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.740
but someone like Kasidis
would probably still get off.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.108
I need something stronger
that won’t let him walk free.

00:18:24.148 --> 00:18:25.148
Like?

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.260
That’s confidential.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.460
You don’t have one, do you?

00:18:35.308 --> 00:18:37.310
Another subpoena just went out.

00:18:37.356 --> 00:18:39.588
If he postpones it again,

00:18:39.844 --> 00:18:41.840
an arrest warrant will be on his doorstep.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.948
Damn this guy. He’s wasting my time.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.908
So how’s Thap doing?

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.412
Have you been in contact with him?

00:18:53.436 --> 00:18:54.796
I just talked to him.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.630
How’s everything on his end?

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.604
He’s fine. Nothing unusual.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.556
Just complained that Singapore’s
unbearably hot and wanted to come home.

00:19:05.588 --> 00:19:06.588
That’s all.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.640
Really?

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:09.932
Yeah. But one thing keeps crossing my mind.

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:13.084
I don’t think Kasidis is acting alone.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.404
He has plenty of wingmen, hasn’t he?

00:19:16.436 --> 00:19:18.020
I’m not talking about his minions.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.372
I’m talking about his ally.

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:38.100
That top one, can you bring it a bit higher?

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.708
Make it quick.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.564
We will turn on the lights later.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.196
Yes, like that.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.940
Oh.

00:19:52.012 --> 00:19:54.236
Just when I want something refreshing.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.840
Thank you.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.212
Refreshing…

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.748
and yummy.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.640
Just like you.

00:20:11.564 --> 00:20:12.804
Gosh, Thap.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.428
Hey, hey.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.884
How crisp!

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.020
Here.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.172
You don’t want it anymore?

00:20:27.204 --> 00:20:28.812
I want you to have it too.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.820
We kissed, Mr. Inthu.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.212
You don’t have to think so much about this.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.420
You’re annoying.

00:20:44.628 --> 00:20:46.244
In!

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.540
Khaohom.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.420
Don’t run.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.492
Your leg still hurts.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.428
I’m happy you and Thap stayed.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:57.836
I know.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.836
Khaohom!

00:21:08.092 --> 00:21:10.090
Why did you decide to stay?

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.372
It means a lot to you, doesn’t it?

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.620
And now it means a lot to me too.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.940
Thank you so much, In, for taking me here.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.772
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

00:21:32.788 --> 00:21:34.236
Yes? What’s up?

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.044
I have a stomachache.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.516
I have a wound.

00:21:37.556 --> 00:21:39.020
My arm hurts.

00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:42.916
So you’re all sick, huh?

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.692
Oh, who should I treat first?

00:21:47.716 --> 00:21:50.276
I have a stomachache.

00:21:50.308 --> 00:21:51.484
Okay, okay.

00:21:51.524 --> 00:21:53.180
I’ll treat you all.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.468
Go over there.

00:21:54.492 --> 00:21:56.180
Who gets there first gets treated first.

00:21:56.212 --> 00:21:57.396
Okay? One, two, three, go!

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:24.870
Thap.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.640
What’s wrong?

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.556
Shoulder pain.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.540
Ah, the joys of aging.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.748
But my stamina is still fine.

00:22:35.796 --> 00:22:36.796
You can test it.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.708
Don’t be cheeky.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:40.310
Here.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.210
I’ll help.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.388
Today, you were both a handyman
and a doctor.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.636
Of course you’re sore.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.068
Being here reminds me of those first days
when I decided to become a doctor.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.804
Why did you want to be a doctor?

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.028
I wanted to help people.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.116
That’s all?

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.236
I also wanted to see that everyone
has access to a good public health system,

00:23:17.268 --> 00:23:19.240
see better management,

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.268
see that doctors get enough rest,
have a fair workload,

00:23:22.884 --> 00:23:24.880
and be paid properly.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.652
Something like that.

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.300
A doctor’s life is pretty tough.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.004
It’s easier to be a doctor’s boyfriend, huh?

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.324
What’s the matter?

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.572
I’m not at ease.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.692
I’m worried about you.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:06.444
I promise…

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.708
I will be fine.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:26.970
Hm?

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.380
Thap.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.330
In?

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.140
What did you see?

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:38.884
I…

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:49.508
Don’t tell me now.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:52.836
You might get sick again.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:25:00.660
Don’t worry so much about the future that
you forget we’re happy together right now.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.540
Today, the Criminal Court issued
arrest warrants for Mr. Kasidis Rakvanit,

00:25:25.572 --> 00:25:27.020
a prominent politician,

00:25:27.052 --> 00:25:31.220
on charges of contract killing
and first-degree murder.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.220
Ton, pick up.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.500
Who leaked the news
about the arrest warrants?

00:25:45.524 --> 00:25:46.740
I don’t know.

00:25:46.772 --> 00:25:48.740
I’m trying to call Ton, but he’s not answering.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.532
Answer the phone.

00:25:57.372 --> 00:26:00.388
Mr. Kasidis hasn’t been home
for a few days, sir.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.444
Did he say where he was going?

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.092
No, sir.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.292
I’m telling the truth.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.556
What’s going on, Uncle?

00:26:28.596 --> 00:26:30.172
Why are there police here?

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.644
Tara has woken up.

00:26:32.668 --> 00:26:34.820
She’s going to be the key witness.

00:26:36.716 --> 00:26:38.900
Director, please step inside.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.052
The police need him as a witness.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.028
When did Mrs. Tara wake up?

00:26:50.052 --> 00:26:52.030
Yesterday, but she couldn’t speak yet,

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.980
so we had to wait
until she recovered a bit more.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:55.810
And why the hell didn’t you tell me anything?

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.164
Now’s not the time to get upset.

00:27:01.452 --> 00:27:03.450
You should be worried about Thap.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.080
Sorry.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:16.492
So what’s your next move?

00:27:16.516 --> 00:27:17.756
I’m worried about Thap.

00:27:17.788 --> 00:27:19.108
I got word from my informant,

00:27:19.148 --> 00:27:20.452
but Thap isn’t answering my calls.

00:27:20.476 --> 00:27:21.308
I need to head to Mae Hong Son.

00:27:21.332 --> 00:27:22.332
Wait.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.004
When?

00:27:24.028 --> 00:27:25.028
Right now.

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:26.710
Can you wait?

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.390
Why?

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.308
I’m going to pack.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.130
I’m coming with you.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.300
Just a sec.

00:27:38.332 --> 00:27:39.508
Yeah, take your time.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.564
(Good luck, Pong.)

00:28:10.596 --> 00:28:12.572
(I hope you become a doctor
like you’ve always dreamed.)

00:28:12.596 --> 00:28:13.884
(Live a good life.)

00:28:13.908 --> 00:28:15.620
(And don’t whine.)

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.308
(We just graduated.
(We aren’t parted by death, jackass.)

00:28:18.348 --> 00:28:20.804
(I can always go see you, okay?)

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.320
Give it back.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.524
Ton!

00:28:24.548 --> 00:28:25.692
Let’s go eat first.

00:28:25.716 --> 00:28:27.556
I need to study for the exams.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.028
(Thought you said
you’d always come see me.)

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.676
(You’re the one who disappeared,
Ton, you asshole.)

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.060
(I miss you so damn much.)

00:28:40.972 --> 00:28:42.572
Hey, what are you doing?

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.708
I didn’t disappear on you.

00:28:55.628 --> 00:28:57.492
Yeah, just forget it.

00:28:57.524 --> 00:28:58.524
Let’s go.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:00.948
Wait.

00:29:02.284 --> 00:29:04.280
I really didn’t disappear on you.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.212
You’re the one who faded from me.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.636
I thought you didn’t like that I liked you.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.036
I didn’t know that.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.964
I thought you kept your distance
because you were embarrassed

00:29:14.988 --> 00:29:16.748
when people teased
that I was your boyfriend.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:18.796
Embarrassed by what?

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.724
I already liked you back then.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:48.420
You’re a heart doctor, aren’t you?

00:29:50.316 --> 00:29:52.652
Yeah, why?

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:56.732
Can you take care of my heart?

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.972
Leaving it with you should be the best option.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:07.396
Yes.

00:30:07.436 --> 00:30:08.436
Let’s go already.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:11.612
Not taking your bag?

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.564
Thank you.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.230
I’ll take this one, please, Auntie.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:35.692
Here.

00:30:35.852 --> 00:30:37.108
In.

00:30:37.132 --> 00:30:38.164
Thap.

00:30:38.204 --> 00:30:40.444
Uncle and Auntie want to see you.

00:30:40.468 --> 00:30:41.868
Come, come.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.604
Come and change.

00:30:43.636 --> 00:30:44.620
Change?

00:30:44.652 --> 00:30:47.116
I prepared outfits for both of you.

00:30:47.148 --> 00:30:48.148
Okay, ma’am.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.310
What outfits?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.428
The local traditional outfits.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:54.610
Let’s go.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.240
Oh!

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.404
In and Thap are done changing.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.180
Goodness, look how lovely you both look.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.028
Come here, guys.

00:31:13.044 --> 00:31:15.716
Come get the holy threads from the elders.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.720
Step forward, dears.

00:31:35.164 --> 00:31:36.508
This feels just like a wedding.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.604
Where’s my dowry?

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.460
In, let’s take a photo.

00:32:27.212 --> 00:32:28.660
In, Thap.

00:32:28.692 --> 00:32:29.572
Hm?

00:32:29.612 --> 00:32:31.244
Let’s go dance.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.572
Dance?

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.100
Khaohom, I don’t know how to dance.

00:32:36.148 --> 00:32:38.660
Please, Thap. Please.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.356
Okay.

00:32:40.388 --> 00:32:42.360
We’re right behind you.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.820
You said this is like a wedding.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.380
Here’s your chance to dance.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.868
So if you dance with me,

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.916
that means you agree to marry me?

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:03.470
I don’t know.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.428
This is the first year I get to celebrate
New Year’s outside the hospital.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:13.852
Really?

00:34:13.876 --> 00:34:14.876
Mm.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:19.076
So you’re always in the hospital
every New Year?

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.100
Yes.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.356
It’s the busiest time of the year.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:28.836
A doctor like me doesn’t get
normal days like everyone else.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.612
I only have two types of days:
on-call days and off-call days.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.980
I don’t have special occasions either.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.860
Every day feels ordinary.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.820
No celebration.

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.860
It’s no different.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.860
It is.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.960
Hm?

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.356
Because from now on,

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:56.490
I’ll make it special for us.

00:35:04.316 --> 00:35:06.148
Do we have to always dance like this too?

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:09.930
Yes.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:11.350
We do.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.684
But give me some time to practice more.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:24.396
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

00:35:24.428 --> 00:35:31.188
Don’t give up your life for me,
That’s never my creed

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:39.188
Having you close
Is beyond a dream come true

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.572
No matter how far we drift apart

00:35:42.596 --> 00:35:46.332
We’ll always find a way to restart

00:35:46.356 --> 00:35:51.708
Because in this world,
There’s only one you

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:58.756
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

00:35:58.788 --> 00:36:06.604
Being by my side each day is all I need

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.348
Alrighty, before we count down to…

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.724
See? You like handsome men, don’t you?

00:36:17.748 --> 00:36:19.020
How does a handsome man turn out?

00:36:19.044 --> 00:36:21.000
Gosh, such a waste.

00:36:21.036 --> 00:36:23.140
I like his face so much.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.420
He has such a pretty face. What a shame.

00:36:25.452 --> 00:36:27.852
What’s his name again? Do you remember?

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:29.540
Ka… something.

00:36:29.572 --> 00:36:30.876
Ah, Kasidis.

00:36:30.916 --> 00:36:31.972
Right, Kasidis.

00:36:32.004 --> 00:36:33.020
Yes.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.840
Excuse me.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:38.652
Did you say Kasidis?

00:36:38.668 --> 00:36:39.524
Yes.

00:36:39.548 --> 00:36:42.092
He’s wanted for attempting to kill his wife.

00:36:42.132 --> 00:36:43.132
Can you believe it?

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.390
Thap.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.644
So for this special occasion
to welcome the New Year…

00:36:51.684 --> 00:36:54.844
it’s extra special for us Phu Dao villagers,

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.420
because we have two special guests with us:

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.356
Doctor Thapfah and In.

00:37:02.404 --> 00:37:06.108
Yeah!

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.404
We will be fine.

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:10.076
We will be safe.

00:37:10.108 --> 00:37:13.060
- Okay?
- It’s tradition for our guests

00:37:13.108 --> 00:37:19.244
to come up on stage
and sing something nice for us, right?

00:37:19.276 --> 00:37:20.764
Yes!

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.076
Please welcome In.

00:37:23.116 --> 00:37:24.228
In!

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.340
In!

00:37:25.388 --> 00:37:26.164
In!

00:37:26.188 --> 00:37:27.476
In, come up here, dear.

00:37:27.508 --> 00:37:28.340
In!

00:37:28.364 --> 00:37:29.364
Go on.

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:31.236
Sing me a song.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:32.548
In!

00:37:32.572 --> 00:37:33.644
In!

00:37:33.668 --> 00:37:34.596
In!

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:35.660
In!

00:37:35.692 --> 00:37:36.644
In!

00:37:36.684 --> 00:37:40.060
Here he comes.

00:37:40.084 --> 00:37:41.188
A round of applause!

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.396
In.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.460
In.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.516
In.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.540
In.

00:37:53.572 --> 00:37:54.508
In.

00:37:54.532 --> 00:37:55.572
In.

00:37:55.604 --> 00:37:56.564
In.

00:37:56.588 --> 00:37:57.548
In.

00:37:57.588 --> 00:37:58.620
Sing!

00:37:58.668 --> 00:37:59.668
Sing.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:03.510
Let’s go, Chief.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:31.052
The moment you came
And changed my fate’s design

00:38:31.084 --> 00:38:38.420
No star above matched
The beauty in your eyes that shine

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:45.652
With every smile you gift,
My trembling heart takes flight

00:38:45.676 --> 00:38:51.868
As long as we share the moon,
There’ll be no more lonely nights

00:38:51.908 --> 00:38:58.884
I want to steal and give you
A glowing star from skies above

00:38:58.916 --> 00:39:05.844
Hold you close beneath the moonlight,
Every night whisper love

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:12.660
The fairest gift of all,
Of anything I’ve ever seen

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:19.692
Is you by my side,
Watching the moon together…

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:29.052
But none more beautiful
Than your eyes are

00:39:29.084 --> 00:39:33.964
More beautiful, your eyes are

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.960
TON

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.628
Yes, Ton?

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.124
Woo-hoo!

00:39:42.148 --> 00:39:42.980
More!

00:39:43.012 --> 00:39:44.308
More!

00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:45.004
What did you say?

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.076
I can’t hear you. It’s loud over here.

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:46.804
More!

00:39:46.844 --> 00:39:48.564
More!

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.868
Okay. Wait a second.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.324
That’s so good.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.836
I just wish he could sing 20 more songs,
but the night would be too long.

00:39:58.868 --> 00:39:59.868
Wait.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.852
Help me with the countdown.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.420
And now it’s the moment
we’ve all been waiting for.

00:40:07.452 --> 00:40:08.316
What’s up?

00:40:08.356 --> 00:40:09.948
(Listen carefully, Thap.)

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.820
(Don’t leave the house. Keep your eyes open.)

00:40:12.852 --> 00:40:14.188
(There’s my guy…)

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.364
Ten…

00:40:16.396 --> 00:40:17.868
Nine…

00:40:17.908 --> 00:40:19.212
Eight…

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.920
Seven…

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:23.410
Six…

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.200
Five…

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.044
Four…

00:40:34.084 --> 00:40:36.524
I dreamed that you were lying there,
covered in blood.

00:40:36.548 --> 00:40:38.520
I don’t know if I can save you in time.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.492
Three…

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.800
Two…

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.200
Move!

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.508
When I see death coming,
I can’t do anything.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:53.980
One…

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.092
Happy New Year!

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:03.410
Oops!

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:12.596
Someone’s been shot!

00:41:12.884 --> 00:41:14.084
Thap!

00:41:14.116 --> 00:41:15.116
Honey!

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:16.756
Thap!

00:41:16.772 --> 00:41:17.308
Thap!

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:17.812
Thap!

00:41:17.836 --> 00:41:18.836
Thap!

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.068
Everyone, stay calm.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.052
This is the police.

00:41:24.076 --> 00:41:24.820
Be still!

00:41:24.852 --> 00:41:25.852
Thap!

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.516
Thap!

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.428
Cuff him.

00:41:33.452 --> 00:41:34.484
Don’t move!

00:41:36.316 --> 00:41:38.812
You’re done. Get him out of here.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:40.940
Come.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.812
Don’t resist.

00:41:41.828 --> 00:41:42.740
Everyone, out of the way.

00:41:42.764 --> 00:41:43.764
Let me see the casualty.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.880
Thap!

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.580
Please help him.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.492
I don’t think he hit any vital areas.

00:41:52.532 --> 00:41:53.812
Shut up, asshole.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.160
Thap.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.092
Is that your undercover guy?

00:41:58.116 --> 00:41:59.236
Yeah, why?

00:41:59.284 --> 00:42:01.972
He didn’t pull off
the crazy act very well, damn it.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:06.220
Thap.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:09.572
Please be okay.

00:42:14.708 --> 00:42:16.036
One, two, three.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:44.404
I bought this for you so you’ll be safe.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.652
The police have arrested
Mr. Kasidis Rakvanit in Phu Dao village,

00:43:00.676 --> 00:43:01.940
Mae Hong Son province,

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:06.620
after he shot Doctor Thapfah Kittipokin,
causing a severe injury.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:13.236
The hospital urgently needs
a donation of blood type AB Rh-.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.332
Pong!

00:43:22.388 --> 00:43:23.604
How’s Thap doing?

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.308
It doesn’t look like the bullet hit
any vital organs, but he’s lost a lot of blood.

00:43:26.332 --> 00:43:27.812
We’re waiting on donors.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.420
Yeah, it’s a pretty damn rare blood type.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:41.810
In.

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.692
Thank you for taking care of Thap.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.468
If I’d done a better job,
he wouldn’t have gotten shot.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.020
No, In.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.836
This is not your fault.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:01.396
You saved him from the car accident
and brought him here to Mae Hong Son.

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.732
Trust me, you’re the biggest help.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.132
Are you relatives of
the patient named Thapfah?

00:44:12.164 --> 00:44:13.164
Yes.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.676
Someone’s come in to donate blood for him.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:36.836
Wan!

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.420
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
AND TAKE CARE OF ME TOO. — WAN

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.540
Wan?

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:55.620
How is Thap?

00:44:55.668 --> 00:44:57.956
What happened? Why did he get shot?

00:44:57.988 --> 00:44:59.260
Long story.

00:44:59.308 --> 00:45:01.740
Let’s just say he’ll be fine
once he gets a blood donation.

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:05.332
I forgot you and Thap
have the same blood type.

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.276
Good timing, I have a concert here.

00:45:08.308 --> 00:45:10.812
I’ll go donate. We’ll talk later.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:18.870
This is In,

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:20.900
Dao’s friend.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:22.820
He’s the one who helped Thap.

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:29.028
Thank you so much for helping our Thap.

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:30.556
Thank you.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:32.580
Thank you.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.028
Donor, please.

00:45:54.204 --> 00:45:57.172
Well then… will you excuse me?

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:01.710
In.

00:46:03.484 --> 00:46:05.764
I think Thap would want to see you first
when he wakes up.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.796
Wan, thank you for giving blood to Thap.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:51.900
He’ll be alright. Trust me.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.868
The surgery went well.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.148
The patient is safe now.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.612
Thank you so much, Doctor.

00:47:50.628 --> 00:47:51.628
Thank you.

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.372
Thank you so much, Wan.

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:13.908
Now that the patient’s safe,
go home and get cleaned up, son.

00:48:13.948 --> 00:48:15.348
You can come back later.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.548
Yes, ma’am.

00:48:23.044 --> 00:48:25.040
May I bother you with one thing?

00:49:23.276 --> 00:49:26.876
You said being a doctor
means getting used to death.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.524
Aren’t you afraid of dying?

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:34.110
No.

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:37.020
Why not?

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:42.564
Death isn’t scary, In.

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:48.356
What’s scary is
worrying about the ones left behind.

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:55.140
Before this,
it was only my family I worried about.

00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:59.676
But now… I don’t want to die.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.080
You know why?

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:05.030
Why?

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:09.012
Because I don’t want you
to be left alone again.

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:19.180
Are you going to
keep hitting on me nonstop?

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.364
Have I succeeded?

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.060
No.

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:31.630
Get some sleep.

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:56.228
Someone is taking this chance
to finish Thap off.

00:50:56.252 --> 00:50:58.940
The police can’t even tell
a lousy act from the truth.

00:50:58.964 --> 00:51:01.108
Thank you, Wan,
for donating blood for Thap.

00:51:01.148 --> 00:51:03.110
I’m glad I could help.

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:04.996
This is pure destiny.

00:51:05.036 --> 00:51:07.000
If you two don’t mind,

00:51:07.028 --> 00:51:08.572
I think you should get back together.

00:51:08.596 --> 00:51:12.412
His family was there
and I don’t know where I stand in his life.

00:51:12.428 --> 00:51:13.452
Are you a fortune teller, In?

00:51:13.476 --> 00:51:14.660
Can you read my fortune?

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.388
What do you want to know, Wan?

00:51:16.436 --> 00:51:21.804
I want to know if I have a chance
to get back together with my ex.
