00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.150
Director,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.590
I've finished taking the blood pressure

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.710
for the patient in bed 3,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.350
and here are the test results for bed 4.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.410
Please take a look.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.039
Alright.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.840
You may go.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.800
Siyun.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.310
Aunt Nan.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.210
Did you get your medicine?

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.870
Yes.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.130
I just have one concern.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.590
Well,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.400
after taking

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.030
this kind of contraceptive,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.910
will I be unable to
get pregnant in the future?

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.710
No.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.360
The contraceptive I prescribed for you

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.170
is imported from Germany,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.000
and you can still conceive
after you stop taking it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.680
It's designed to give us women

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.720
greater freedom

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.820
in deciding about having children.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.840
Thank you.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.360
Aunt Nan,

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.380
I have something
I'd like to discuss with you.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.630
Go ahead.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.560
Recently, Sichuan has been hit by famine
and plague outbreaks.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.750
I'd like to organize a charity fundraiser

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.710
in the name of our Sinan Hospital

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.710
to raise donations of medicine
for disaster victims.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.740
Aunt Nan, what do you think?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.380
Of course, no problem.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.120
I'll help you invite

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.780
some social elites to attend.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.160
Thank you, Aunt Nan.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.800
By the way,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.079
remember to take the pill on schedule.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.360
Don't forget.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.400
Got it.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.240
Is Kang Kaisheng

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.680
your new pen name?

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.040
Don't be ridiculous.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.090
What?

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.130
You like his articles?

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.030
This guy is quite bold in his writing—

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.090
every point targets the government.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.030
Your newspaper is quite bold as well,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.690
willing to publish anything.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.860
Some people say he's a Communist.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.250
What do you think?

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.810
I don't know what his intentions are.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.410
Stay away from him.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640
I barely know him.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.570
What did you want to see me about?

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.210
About what I mentioned before—

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.140
the disaster relief fundraising.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.190
I want to buy a front-page spot.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.720
Help me design it, will you?

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.740
-Cheng, you're here.
-Mr. Lu.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.750
You guys talk.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.050
I'll handle what you asked me to do.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.980
Goodbye, Mr. Lu.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.690
Boss, let's go inside and talk.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.120
Boss.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.220
My men saw Mr. Dalun

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.670
doing business with Huang Aniu,

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.529
and they took some photos of them.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.640
Take a look.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.360
Huang Aniu was caught before
selling opium with the Japanese—

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.680
and he still dares to do this?

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.480
The Japanese?

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.270
The Master explicitly forbids

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.310
selling opium.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.720
And now he's involved with the Japanese.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.920
The Master won't tolerate
either of those things,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.190
and Mr. Dalun has done both.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.390
When has he ever listened to the Master?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.130
True.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.300
Cheng.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.510
From today on,

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.830
have our men keep a close watch on Dalun.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.440
Got it.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.590
I'll go see to it now.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.640
Mom.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.120
You're back.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.570
Come here.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.170
I have something to tell you.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.090
What is it?

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.120
Xiong...

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.070
he passed away.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.950
His grandmother asked me to
give you a message.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.680
Xiong wanted to tell you

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.950
that he was sorry.

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.690
The arranged marriage wasn't
Xiong's fault.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.780
That's true.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.310
We should pick a day

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.500
to burn incense and joss paper for him.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.650
After all,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.890
he was still family.

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.950
Okay.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.120
I also want to apologize to you.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.720
Marriage is such an important matter,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.450
yet I couldn't even protect your right
to choose.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.480
It's alright, Mom.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.880
That's all behind us now.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.240
Mom hopes that in the future,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.420
you can find someone you truly love,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.070
who is decent, good-tempered,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.670
and will cherish you.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.160
Anyway, I definitely won't

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.490
marry someone like Dad.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.430
What did you want to see me about?

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.560
Sit.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.380
Do you know Huang Aniu?

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.360
Huang Aniu?

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.240
Let me think...

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.530
No, I don't know him.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.590
Then I'll tell you.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.750
Huang Aniu made his fortune

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.750
by selling opium with the Japanese.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.210
He's been quite active lately.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.360
Then this bastard really deserves to die.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.090
Should he die for selling opium

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.000
or for collaborating with the Japanese?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.260
Whatever the reason, he deserves to die.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.440
Do you want me to use

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.720
my connections in the Revival Society
to take care of him?

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.520
Dalun.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.310
I don't care what society you're in.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.000
There are two things I've always stressed.

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:38.159
Don't sell opium.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.270
Don't cooperate with the Japanese.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.270
Father taught us these from a young age.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.180
These are our principles—

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.020
our bottom line.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.010
I have principles and a bottom line.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.830
I know you and Father both care for me.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.540
So how could I make such a mistake?

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.330
His name is Huang Aniu?

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.960
He told me his name was Li Zeqing.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.440
I did do business with him
in the Northeast.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:38.750
I owe him money.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.780
He followed me to Shanghai

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.610
and forced me to deal in opium with him.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.910
I originally thought I'd just pay him back

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.570
and then cut all ties with him.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.320
He actually has dealings
with the Japanese.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.600
Don't worry.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.840
From now on,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.620
I'll never contact him again.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.190
Don't worry about me anymore.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.990
You're not going to drink it
just because it makes you sick?

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.480
Once you get used to it,
you won't get sick.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.270
Alright.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:09.820
Father.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.580
Father.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.630
What are you two brothers talking about?

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.490
Just chatting.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.750
Did you get into trouble again?

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.350
He's about to cause trouble.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.150
What have you done this time?

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:20.870
I'm asking you!

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.750
He wants to make boiled pork
with pickled cabbage

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.000
for your birthday.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.880
That's right.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.410
Your birthday is coming up, isn't it?

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.790
I'm planning to show off my cooking skills

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.250
at your birthday banquet.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.550
You mean that over-salted
pickled cabbage stew you made?

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.690
It's boiled pork with pickled cabbage.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:38.900
Whatever it is,

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.010
I don't want all my guests
choking on all that salt.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.210
I'll be careful with the salt this time.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.930
Keep an eye on him for me.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.900
Alright, you two carry on.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.150
Mom, you look great.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.810
You should keep having
the bird's nest soup.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:58.600
Alright.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.480
Thanks.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.400
You'd better behave yourself.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.940
Boss, we'll start from Suzhou Creek here

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.870
and follow this road into the city.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.910
Then we'll reach here

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.030
and continue down this way.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.550
However, if the weather is nice,

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.840
we'll go this route...

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.240
Who are you?

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.480
You're Attorney Cheng, right?

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.410
What do you want?

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.220
I'm a journalist from a newspaper,

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.670
and I'd like to ask you
to write an article.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.920
Look at you, so sloppy

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.110
and sneaky.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.670
What could you possibly write?

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.240
I'm Lu Yingchen's colleague

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.480
and his good friend.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.560
Mr. Lu's friend.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.950
Come in.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.540
This is an article I wrote.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.690
This is my pen name.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.270
You should know it, right?

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:03.870
Hello.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.030
I'm Cheng Ao.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.720
Attorney Cheng.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.180
This is an article I wrote.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.380
Under the pen name Kang Kaisheng.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.040
So you're the one whose every viewpoint

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.280
criticizes the government.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.250
That's me.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.250
Please, have a seat.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.200
Thank you.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.350
What brings you here?

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.910
I came today

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.730
on behalf of our newspaper

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.000
to commission you to write an article.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.330
I've never written articles before.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.910
I saw you defending
those anti-Japanese students in court.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.560
You have a strong sense of justice.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.610
I just feel

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.870
that you must have many more

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.600
genuine ideas
that you haven't fully expressed.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.430
As it happens,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.750
our newspaper is willing to give you

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.150
such an opportunity.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.910
You can express all your ideas

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.000
and principles in writing.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.790
This way,

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.470
they can reach a wider audience
of young people,

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.120
including those students who are lost

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.900
yet seeking the light.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.870
Mr. Kang,

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.930
I am a lawyer.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.950
Whether my client that day was a student

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.480
or a murderer,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.060
I must do my best to defend them.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.270
That's my duty as a lawyer.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.210
Attorney Cheng,

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.410
how is student Xiaoshan doing now?

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:18.750
If needed,

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.030
I can arrange for him

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.630
and other students
who seek enlightenment...

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.410
to go to the Soviet area together.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.270
What area?

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:30.910
The Soviet area.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.440
Soviet area?

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.420
What area is the Soviet area?

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.500
Is it a district in Suzhou?

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:40.980
Yes.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.720
By the way,

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.080
Attorney Cheng,

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.550
I heard

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.370
you generously donated to Sinan Hospital's

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.000
charity fundraiser this time.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.320
But I wonder,
after collecting these medicines,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.320
how do you plan to

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.290
safely transport them to Sichuan?

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.910
That's something
Director Lin should worry about.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:03.720
I don't know.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.390
What about the article commission?

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.550
That's enough.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.140
Attorney Cheng is very busy today.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.870
You should go. Come on, come on.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.850
Well then, Attorney Cheng,
I'll take my leave now.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:16.450
Take care.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.780
I'm sorry.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:21.620
I'm sorry.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.780
That dude doesn't look like
he's up to any good.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.670
Why are you looking at me? Keep moving!

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.330
Waiting for me to walk you out?

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.160
He really doesn't seem like
a decent person.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.120
So sneaky.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.540
Close the door properly.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.870
Just now I said if the weather is good,

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.440
we can take this route, right?

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.360
[Four Seas Peide Jetty]

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.120
They're cracking down hard lately.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.980
This is all I can get you this time.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.840
When will the next shipment arrive?

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.750
Didn't I tell you?
They're cracking down hard lately.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.720
Next time isn't guaranteed.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.050
I'll let you know later.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:10.930
Huang Aniu.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.980
From now on, you've got a new name:

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:15.600
Li Zeqing.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:23.500
Young Master.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.370
We were being tailed just now.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.170
Who sent them?

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:27.870
Cheng's men.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.360
What?

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.390
They didn't see me, did they?

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.270
Don't worry,

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.250
I've caught them all

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.510
and taken care of them.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.040
Good.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.140
What?

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.050
Do you know this person?

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.470
Who?

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.840
Yes, I do.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.380
This guy has become quite famous lately.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.650
Hasn't he already approached you?

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.800
He approached me.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.010
Have you been spying on me?

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.150
Look at how paranoid you are.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.150
Someone has been spying on Kang Kaisheng

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.550
and saw him approach you.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.120
Since you're here,

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.050
let's discuss this together.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.800
You know,

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.310
the articles this man has published lately

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.910
are extremely provocative,

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.710
reeking of communist leanings.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.600
Go on.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.780
But it'd be strange to say
he's definitely a Communist.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.000
How did he manage to
get his articles published, anyway?

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:34.380
The only thing I'm certain of

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.780
right now is

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.610
that he has someone backing him,

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.200
but who could it be?

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.200
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.500
You suspect he's working for me?

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.930
I didn't say anything.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.390
Your eyes already give it away.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.170
Tell me what he said
when he came to see you.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.870
This man approached me
with clear intentions.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.050
Last time he tried to
trick me into talking

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.250
and even implied that I was a Communist.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.080
So are you one or not?

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.500
What's that supposed to mean?

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.950
He's your guy, isn't he?

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.430
How could he be my guy?

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.700
I would never investigate you.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.550
Right.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.690
You don't investigate.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.010
Usually,

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.630
you just frame me directly.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.550
Wh-What do you mean by that?

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.260
Remember to
attend Nan's charity gala tonight!

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.440
If you're going, how could I not go?

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.870
Thank you very much

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.030
to every kind-hearted guest here today.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.960
Today,

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.750
we've gathered here to raise funds

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.080
for medicines for those disaster victims

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.550
suffering from the plague
and to do our part

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.960
in supporting the relief efforts.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.840
At the same time,

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.960
I'm also grateful

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.910
to have witnessed
the growth of a dear friend.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.270
Her persistence has deeply moved me.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.390
Without her,

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.990
there would be no Sinan Hospital today.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.930
I'd like to invite her on stage
to say a few words.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.260
Thank you, Mrs. Shen,
for your praise and recognition.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.170
Our Sinan Hospital will donate

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.000
all of our medicine supplies
to the disaster area.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:18.240
At the same time, I'd like to appeal to

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.170
every benevolent guest here today

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.310
to contribute whatever you can.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:23.480
Is that so, Miss Lin?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.540
What you're saying sounds very noble,

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.670
but from what I know,

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.270
the medicine donations
your Sinan Hospital raised this time

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.680
probably aren't being sent

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.880
to Sichuan, are they?

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.860
Sir,

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.310
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.110
Our fundraising is supervised
by the government.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.230
If you don't have solid evidence,

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.100
my lawyer is right here,

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.020
and I can sue you for defamation.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.730
By government,

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.390
you wouldn't happen to mean
the Shen family, would you?

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.930
I've looked into your Sinan Hospital's

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.090
medication procurement list this time.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.590
The amounts clearly exceed
what's needed for the plague.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.480
Who knows if your Sinan Hospital

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.630
is taking advantage of
the Shen family's protection

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.270
to work with outside accomplices,

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.270
doing all sorts of

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.370
shady business behind closed doors,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.720
just to line your own pockets...

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.790
Stop, stop, stop.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.880
You're Kang Kaisheng?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.810
Yes.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.000
Take him away.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.350
What are you doing?

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:17.650
What are you doing?

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.480
Let go of me!

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.160
Let go of me!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.960
Let go of me!

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.030
Let go of me!

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.960
Let go of me!

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.270
Who was that man at the gala?

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.030
Why was he targeting me?

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.350
And why did Shen Yiqun suddenly step in

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.610
and have him arrested?

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.700
Was he helping us?

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:41.750
Not "us,"

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:42.400
just you.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.670
He was helping you.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.160
Yeah.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720
Isn't he into you?

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.240
Why are you such a pain?

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.200
Right.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.680
I'm a pain,

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.720
while Shen Yiqun is likable.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.750
I know.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.020
I'm leaving then.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.850
Where are you going?

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.860
Going to have noodles with Shen Yiqun.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:12.660
Go ahead then.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.610
Not leaving?

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.850
How can I leave when you're pulling me?

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.420
Still not leaving?

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.050
Can't bear to leave me?

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.830
I just can't bear to leave Shen Yiqun.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.480
So what?

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.460
Then you have to have noodles with me.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.710
I can't bear to let you go.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.830
Don't pull me. I can walk by myself.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.680
Where's Cheng?

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.920
He said he'd treat me to noodles,

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.520
but he's nowhere to be found.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.590
Admit it—you're the one craving noodles,

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.720
and you claimed Cheng invited us here.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.400
What?

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.170
If I had been the one who wanted to eat,

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:07.900
you wouldn't have come with me?

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.710
That would depend on my mood.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.330
You're full of pride, aren't you?

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.350
How are you?

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.590
Are you injured?

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.440
Where are you injured? Let me see.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.270
I'm fine.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.810
And I'm not injured.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.440
You must have been terrified.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.830
It's okay now.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:55.610
I'm here.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.210
How is Cheng Ao?

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.480
The doctor said

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.110
the knife wound isn't deep.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.550
After it's been stitched up,

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.610
he'll be fine after a few days of rest.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.790
What a pity.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.020
You're a doctor too.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.550
Do you doctors have
some kind of drug that,

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.790
when injected into someone's body,

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:16.750
will make them never wake up again?

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:17.510
If you do, give it to me now,

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.830
and I'll go in there
and inject him with it.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.350
Taking you out for noodles
this late at night?

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.190
Shanghai is in such chaos right now.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.320
He still has enemies out there.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.730
Does he not know that?

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.480
Luckily, nothing serious happened
this time,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.340
but what if something really bad happens
next time?

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.720
Alright.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.170
I'll take you home.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.390
I'm not leaving.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.100
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.900
What's the point of you staying?

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:55.740
Go home and get some rest.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.720
I'll bring you back tomorrow.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.280
Come on!

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.720
I want to stay and keep him company.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.720
Then I'll stay to keep you company.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.160
Can you just leave me alone for a while?

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.680
Shen Yiqun.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:49.960
Can you stop using

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.440
your concern to emotionally manipulate me?

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.850
It only makes things awkward between us.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.720
I don't like it.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.220
Can you respect me?

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.810
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.120
I'll leave two men downstairs for you.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.600
Help.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.510
Help. I can't take it anymore.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.970
It hurts, it hurts so much.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.090
G-Get me a glass of water.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.150
The doctor said your injury isn't serious.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.480
Stop pretending.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:34.420
Fine.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.170
Have you been here the whole time?

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.290
Why are you still holding my pocket watch?

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.800
Thankfully, this pocket watch

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.000
took the stab for you.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.450
Otherwise, you'd be dead by now.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:02.830
This pocket watch

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.700
was left to me by my mother.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.170
I never thought

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.070
they'd still be protecting me even now.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.210
You were quite cute as a child.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.980
Do you like this watch?

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.540
Even if you do, I can't give it to you.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.270
Give it back.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.790
Why?

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.620
I'm saving this watch

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.040

I came up for some fresh air.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.770

I'll smoke, and you can just
enjoy the smell.

Don't smoke either.

You punk,

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.480

Look at you.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.080
You've always been smart—

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.610
smarter than me at least,

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.000
and better educated too.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.110
I really don't understand
what you're thinking.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.750
Now that the national situation is
crystal clear,

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.110
you could do anything else,

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.790
but you had to pick
the most dangerous path.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.850
What's going on in that head of yours?

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.280
You're smarter than me.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:23.140
You're too smart for your own good.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.520
What do you mean by choosing paths?

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:28.210
I'm working as a lawyer, aren't I?

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:29.760
I don't understand.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.110
Keep playing dumb then.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.350
I'm only saying this

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.340
because I see you as a brother.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.000
Fine, thanks.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.000
Where's Cheng?

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.160
How would I know?

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.240
He's your man.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400
He's my man.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.380
But maybe you should ask your men.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.450
Wait, what do you mean by that?

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.420
You suspect my men did this?

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.110
Without my orders,

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.400
who would dare do such a thing?

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.200
If my men did it,

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:10.830
I'd

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.730
throw myself off the hospital roof today,

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.750
headfirst to the ground.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.190
Fine.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.670
I'd send you a wreath by then.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.410
Get some rest.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.110
Did you hurt Cheng Ao?

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.380
Are you behind Kang Kaisheng?

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.250
Cheng Ao is pro-Communist.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.390
Do you think I'm pro-Communist or not?

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.940
Young Master.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.000
Being soft-hearted now
will only backfire on you.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.690
If you don't make your mark now,

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:31.790
people like Shen Yiqun

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.800
will crush you under their feet.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.730
By then, you won't even be able to
turn things around.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.120
Jin.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.560
Get up.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.440
Are we buddies or not?

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.730
Yes.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.980
From now on, stay out of

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.200
Cheng Ao's business.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.430
I looked into it.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.160
Cheng Ao and Zeng Dalun's fathers

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.400
were sworn brothers,

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.160
with Cheng Ao's father
being the elder one.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.030
So that means

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.200
the former leader of this gang

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.650
was Cheng Ao's father.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.510
Well, 10 years ago,

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.410
Cheng Ao's parents suddenly died,

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:47.170
and Mr. Zeng

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.330
naturally took over as the new leader.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.440
As for Cheng Ao,

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.960
he became Mr. Zeng's adopted son...

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.160
What kind of investigation is that?

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.510
Everyone on the street knows that.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.880
Right, I'm useless.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.240
There's more.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.240
Zeng Dalun gives off a dangerous vibe.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.500
-He can't be controlled...
-I know that.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.830
Well...

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.060
I think Cheng Ao is a good guy.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.580
This young man

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:11.890
is ambitious,

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.830
compassionate,

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.910
and well-respected.

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.480
If we could get him on our side,

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.000
he'd be a valuable asset...

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.790
I know that too.

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.520
Tell me something I don't know.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.400
I've heard rumors...

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.540
Cheng Ao has connections with
the Communists.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.190
What did you say?

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.320
Some people say

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.820
Cheng Ao is connected to the Communists.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:35.580
Huang, you really are useless.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.180
Don't make claims without evidence again!

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:38.980
Yes, yes, yes.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.960
Understood.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:41.900
Understood.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.880
That's all?

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:50.550
That's all.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:51.790
Then why are you still standing here?

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.920
Yes, I'm going then.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.670
Boss, we found Cheng.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.600
Where is he?

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.970
I'll take you to him.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.250
Let's go.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:31.940
Boss.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.110
Cheng.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.430
You almost got me killed.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.430
I'm sorry, Boss.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:52.220
Well...

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:54.440
Jin threatened me with my family.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.680
How did those people target you?

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:04.520
Remember

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.670
when you asked me to tail Huang Aniu?

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.400
Then I wasn't careful

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.230
and got captured by him instead.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.850
Oh, right, Boss,

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.659
there are Japanese guys among those thugs.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:23.739
Alright, got it.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.480
Anyway, that's what happened.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.210
I'll pack my things
in the next couple of days

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:30.920
and head back to the Northeast.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.250
I'm too ashamed
to show my face around you.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:36.719
I truly appreciate how
you've looked after me all these years.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.290
Stop pretending.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.090
I'm not pretending.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.900
Can you still move around?

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:46.570
Move around...

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.510
I think so.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:48.230
Why?

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:50.110
Get dressed properly.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.840
I'm taking you out for noodles.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:53.550
Noodles, really?

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.840
Yeah.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:57.370
We didn't get to
eat them that day, did we?

00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.190
Don't worry, Boss.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.440
If those guys show up today,

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.070
I'll kick their asses for you.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.400
Don't let these injuries fool you.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.910
I'm tough as nails, I'm telling you.

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:06.710
Yeah, yeah, you're the tough one.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:07.710
Wait for me, Boss.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:18.860
Hello.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:20.400
I have an appointment

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.840
to see Director Lin.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.680
Alright, this way, please.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.900
You can step outside for now.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.100
I'm just going to speak with the doctor.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.400
Do you understand
what it means to respect women?

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.060
This is a maternity hospital!

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.050
You go out too.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.150
I just want a private word
with the doctor.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.870
Yes.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.830
What's wrong?

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:11.480
Are you feeling unwell?

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:13.510
I'm here

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:14.480
just to ask

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.800
if someone like me

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.000
can have an abortion.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.970
I'm sorry, Madam Yanhong,

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:21.430
but abortion is illegal.

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:23.800
But I'm carrying a monster.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:24.920
If I give birth to it,

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.030
I'll die.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.080
How do you know it's a monster?

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:31.010
It's growing inside me.
How could I not know?

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:32.510
Why do you want an abortion?

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.030
I don't like being forced.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.730
I don't love the father of this child.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.380
Anyway, if you won't help me,

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:41.920
I'll go to your hospital lobby,

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.670
grab a pair of scissors,
and cut it out myself.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:44.670
Do you believe me?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Who are you?

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.610
I'm the most miserable woman in the world.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.070
If you keep this up, I'll call the police.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.130
Go ahead then.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.400
The father of this child is so cruel,

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.460
and you people
who run hospitals are just as heartless!

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.860
Why did you come to my room?

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.530
Cheng Ao.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.360
It was my men who hurt you.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.120
It's complicated to explain
in a few words,

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.150
so I won't try to do it.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:39.750
Anyway, I owe you an apology.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.670
Let's put that aside for now.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.130
You have Japanese people

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:46.600
working for you.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:49.000
No way.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:51.280
After you and our old man warned me,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.080
I haven't had any contact with
the Japanese since.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:58.320
Zeng Dalun.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.470
I'm warning you one more time.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.920
Stay away from anything

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.800
to do with the Japanese.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.600
Do you hear me?

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.680
Why are you so long-winded?

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.150
I've always listened to you
since I was little.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.150
Even when I don't listen to the old man,
I listen to you.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.040
Look, is that woman pretty?

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.680
Siyun.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:31.910
Why are you here?

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.000
I'm here to give Sixth Madam a check-up.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.180
I invited her.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.400
Miss Lin is now Shanghai's

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.060
most renowned gynecologist.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:40.860
Let's go, Sister-in-law.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.260
I'll take you to her room.

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:45.930
You might as well hit me for real.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.220
Goodbye, Sister-in-law.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:53.670
Let me walk you there.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.000
Dr. Lin,

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.310
thank you for coming all the way here.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.500
It's my job.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:11.080
Please, this way.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:11.520
Okay.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.150
What seems to be the problem?

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.210
I suddenly bled a little today.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.710
Do you think I could have miscarried?

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.880
We'll need to examine you
to know for sure.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.280
Please, doctor,

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.930
could you help me
terminate this pregnancy?

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.540
I can't.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.300
Father,

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:49.930
is Madam Yanhong alright?

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.150
She's fine.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.940
She even performed "The Heavenly Maidens
Scattering Flowers" for me just now.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:54.670
That's good.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:55.880
How's your recovery?

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.890
I'm doing well.

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:58.480
Did the Anhui gang do it?

00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.590
No.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.150
We've found Cheng too.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.880
Did he say who the attacker was?

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.970
We're still investigating it.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.880
If you need anything from me,

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:11.930
just say it.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:14.590
Father.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.150
I know the Zeng family wharf isn't open
to outsiders,

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.480
but I'd like to borrow it

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:21.510
to transport some supplies

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:22.710
to the disaster area.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.110
You silly boy.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:32.990
What do you mean by
"borrowing our family's wharf"?

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:35.400
In the future, you'll be

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.590
in charge of our entire family.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.760
Thank you, Father.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.240
Are you fully healed from your injury?

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.810
Didn't you say it wasn't a serious wound?

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.800
I still have to ask
if you're fully recovered.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.860
I'm all better now.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.590
With you by my side,

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:09.700
what injury wouldn't heal?

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.620
I'm driving.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.340
Your father's sixth concubine
wants an abortion.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.450
W-what?

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.330
You mean Madam Yanhong?

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:41.860
What did she say?

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:46.670
I feel like...

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.910
she's being held against her will

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.310
in your house by Mr. Zeng.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.860
She doesn't love Mr. Zeng.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.050
But she can't escape even if she wants to.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:05.410
She's pitiful.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.620
But Mr. Zeng

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.660
can never know about this.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:11.250
If he finds out...

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.400
would he kill Yanhong?

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.720
Do all the men in your gang

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.150
treat women this way?

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:37.250
Yeah, we all do.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.660
I was just teasing you.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:52.750
I was just kidding.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:56.920
Let go.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.600
Don't be mad anymore.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:15.270
Alright.

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:18.770
I just like girls like you.

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:32.040
Eyes on the road.
Why are you looking at me?
