How did you know I was here?

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.180
There's no one in Shanghai
we can't track down.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.800
I have nothing to say to you.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.070

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.800
Even if you try a few more banks,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.560
the result will be the same.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.800
I know that

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.620
starting a hospital takes a lot of money.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.000
I have a legal and reasonable proposal.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.520
Would you like to hear it?

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.170
Let's talk somewhere else.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.460
Miss Lin, your broken engagement

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.040
did stir up some prejudice,

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.790
but

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.680
the educated scholars

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.800
and intellectual elites around me

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.360
all support your decision.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.590
I may not be a man of status,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.280
but I support you too.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.520
Thank you.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.960
Today I'd like to offer you some advice

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.640
in my professional capacity.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.620
Mr. Qiao has given his orders.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.390
All Chinese banks in Shanghai

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.890
will shut their doors to you.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.610
Have you considered

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.510
the consequences?

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.270
If you overthink things,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.960
you'll never get anything done.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.480
I'm having coffee with you.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.760
Won't Miss Shen mind?

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.360
Overthinking

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.400
means nothing gets done.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.900
Besides, there's

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.030
nothing special between her and me.

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:41.360
You know the Zeng family
can provide loans,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.270
right?

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.440
Yes.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.630
Mr. Zeng may come from the underworld,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.070
but

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.180
he's still a traditional man

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.210
who values integrity.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.680
Your brother can't repay the money

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.340
because he lacks the ability.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.790
Mr. Zeng is naturally unhappy about it.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.590
But you're different, Miss Lin.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.560
I've done some rough research.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.870
Opening a private maternity
hospital in Shanghai

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.120
can be profitable.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.120
At the very least,

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.410
it won't lose money.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.620
Isn't Mr. Zeng

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.890
afraid of crossing Mr. Qiao?

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.080
Now I'm sitting here

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.700
discussing this with you.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.390
Doesn't that answer your question?

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.720
I don't mean to look down
on you or Mr. Zeng.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.570
I just want my hospital's background

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.350
to stay as clean as possible.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.600
If that's the case,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.260
regarding Mr. Zeng's matter,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.340
I won't push it.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.740
I can give you another advice.

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:50.590
Since all Chinese banks in Shanghai
have shut their doors to you,

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.190
you could try foreign banks.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.210
When I was studying in England,

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.159
I had a classmate

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.460
who works at a British bank.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.060
I can introduce you to him.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.000
But to get a bank loan,

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.910
you'll need collateral.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.470
I have nothing to my name.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.580
What can I use as collateral?

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.370
Real estate, for example.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.860
Lin Jinghan would never agree to that.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.010
But you own a share of

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.370
the Lin family house,

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.600
Miss Lin.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.360
Otherwise?

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.690
Do you have any other options?

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.850
Why are you helping me

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.050
and giving me advice?

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.630
Maybe because

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.470
the way you held that knife
was unforgettable.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.670
Are you okay, Mom?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.750
Don't worry.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.500
Lin Siyun,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.750
did you deliberately
make the floor so slippery?

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.080
Were you trying to kill me

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.440
or our mother?

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.510
Come on.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.600
Come out.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.020
I need to talk to you.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.320
You know you have
a fourth aunt in Suzhou, right?

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.050
Fourth aunt?

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.540
Here's the thing.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.390
Our house is going to be sold

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.720
to pay off debts,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.580
and we all have to move out.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.560
But fortunately,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.870
our fourth aunt in Suzhou
is willing to take you in.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.930
I actually think this is a good thing.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.630
Because in Suzhou,

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.080
no one knows the shameful mess

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.670
you made in Shanghai.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.630
If someone takes a liking to you,

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.980
you might still
marry into a wealthy family.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.240
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.040
I have a share in this house.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.950
You haven't read Father's will, have you?

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.810
It's written there, plain as day.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.920
The house and all assets belong to me,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.400
and I'll take care of our mother.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.660
It also states that for the
unmarried daughter of the Lin family,

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.060
I need to provide monthly living expenses.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.790
But now I wonder

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.700
if you were married

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.230
or not.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.030
It doesn't matter.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.600
If you have any difficulties in the future

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.400
or any problems, just come to me,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.240
okay?

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.950
I want to see the will.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.640
Go ahead.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.060
Anytime you want.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.790
It's kept at the lawyer's office.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.670
10 days.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.320
In 10 days,

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.200
someone from Suzhou will come to get you.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:24.960
Get ready

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.360
and pack your things.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.040
Don't leave behind any gold

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.920
or valuables.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.870
Lin Jinghan, you're ridiculous.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.330
Why should I follow your arrangements?

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.390
You're a public disgrace—
do you even realize that?

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.600
All of Shanghai

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.870
knows your name.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.660
It's even in the papers.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.890
You're like a broken drum—

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.320
everyone takes a swing at you.
Do you get it?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.360
Going to Suzhou is your best way out.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.400
I'm doing you a favor.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.080
Fine.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.490
Thank you for your concern.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.780
I need to rest now.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.160
Just one more thing.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.260
you don't need

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.030
to worry about Yi.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.320
I've already spoken

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.860
with Zhu's old lady...

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.670
Did you understand what I said?

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.930
Sweet dreams.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.290
Mom.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.040
The will indeed states

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.480
that all of Mr. Lin's property

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.720
shall be inherited by his son, Lin Jinghan

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.090
and any future grandsons.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.960
For unmarried daughters
and granddaughters,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.400
monthly living expenses must be provided,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.400
but this is canceled upon marriage.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.300
This is not my father's handwriting.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.480
He would never

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.070
have written such a will.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.630
Mr. Lin says

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.520
that when your father wrote his will,

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.580
he was seriously ill with weak hands,

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.970
so he had to ask someone
to write it for him.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.030
Please take a look.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.360
Is this signature authentic?

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.870
Even if it is my father's signature,

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:08.970
does that

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.710
make this will valid?

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.530
Mr. Wang, were you present at the time?

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.030
Was there a notary there?

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.010
Your father's will has always

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.890
been handled by another lawyer.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.720
After Mr. Lin passed away,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.480
that lawyer left our firm

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.480
and disappeared.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.960
I'm so sorry.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.120
The lawyer disappears
at such a critical moment.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.730
What a coincidence.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.240
Mr. Wang,

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.560
I want to sue Lin Jinghan.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.610
I will not recognize this will.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.490
[Six Arts Hall]

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.790
[Ju De Hall Restaurant]

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.590
Can't you really take this case?

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.090
You're one of the most
well-known lawyers in Shanghai.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.070
In the short time we've been sitting here,

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.360
Lin Siyun has already seen

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.480
5 lawyers.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.500
Even Lawyer Xie turned it down.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.870
I doubt anyone in Shanghai

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.280
will dare take it.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.390
I wonder who she's trying

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.550
to sue anyway.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.200
Based on my experience,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.670
your chances of
winning this case are very low.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.290
I'm sorry.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.920
Miss Lin's family
has fallen on hard times—

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920
she has no way out.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.120
But she's strong.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.330
I admire

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.000
women like her.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:27.160
Cheng Ao,

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.910
do you feel sorry for her?

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.200
Yes, I do.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.250
But with her personality,

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.790
I don't think she needs anyone's pity.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.470
How do you know
what her personality's like?

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.550
We had coffee.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:39.630
Where?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.040
Upstairs yesterday.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:41.940
What's wrong?

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.820
I've never even had coffee upstairs.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.640
You should try it.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.390
I meant with you.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.460
Mrs. Shen,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.380
I once read your interview in the paper,

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.000
where you said

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.720
that the progress of Chinese society

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.270
must start with
the standing of Chinese women.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.080
If Chinese women have no standing,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.480
then

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.380
Chinese society

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.870
will have no future either.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.930
Yes, I did say that.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.820
You remember it so clearly.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.150
Many great thinkers
have said similar things.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.030
But

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.840
the way you put it
was simple and powerful,

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.030
and very moving.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.880
Impressive.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.160
So you all think Lin Siyun is great, huh?

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.250
Who's prettier, me or her?

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.240
Of course you are.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.400
I wasn't asking you.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.390
You tell me.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:39.670
Lin Siyun.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.900
Do people in your group have bad taste

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.840
or just bad eyesight?

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.920
Probably both.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.250
I have another case.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.390
Excuse me,

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:01.770
enjoy your tea.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:03.580
Bye, Mr. Cheng.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.790
Yingying,

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.630
what's wrong with you today?

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.230
I've always been like this.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.120
And Cheng Ao—

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.120
he contradicted everything I said.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.570
Did he act like this because he likes me?

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.270
Aunt Nan.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:27.860
Maybe.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.690
Miss Lin.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.370
I've been waiting for you.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.390
I was thinking...

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.790
I was looking for you too.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:43.750
Looking for me?

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.350
If you want to file a lawsuit,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.620
you can consult me.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.000
Thank you.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.210
Let's talk in my office.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.200
I want to sue my brother.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.140
Lin Jinghan is suspected of forging a will

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.320
and seizing property
that belongs to me and my niece.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.120
What did Xie and those lawyers

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.190
say just now?

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.120
They said

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.760
since I broke off my engagement

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.860
and now want to sue my own brother,

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.360
I have a bad reputation

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.600
among the upper class

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.790
in Shanghai.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.650
Any lawyer with a shred of dignity

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.720
would refuse to take my case.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.800
I'll help you.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.320
Thank you.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.810
Can you afford the legal fees?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.030
How much?

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.170
I charge 3 times what Xie does.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:56.930
Can I pay in installments?

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.170
Let's win the case first.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.090
I need to talk to you.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.660
Are you really going to sue your brother?

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:47.970
Yes.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.400

Fine.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.270
also cruel and vicious.

Don't you forget.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.790
I gave birth to you

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.390

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.520
Have you lost all conscience?

You're so nice to her,

but does she even care about you?

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.350
Whether she cares about me is between us.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.350
I'm done talking to you.

what's really going on
between you and Miss Lin?

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.820
Miss Lin has done nothing wrong.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.370
It's all my fault.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.080
That's it?

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:54.220
Go on.

Thankfully, Mr. Cheng found
those letters of mine

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.890
and stopped me from
making mistakes in time.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.590
My lifestyle

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.400
may be acceptable to many girls,

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.440
but Miss Lin isn't one of them.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.560
Continuing would only hurt her.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.200
The way things are now

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.060
is the best outcome for everyone.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:24.000

I'd like to offer a toast.

Well,

I'll be leaving now.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.330
Mrs. Shen,

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.610
I've already planned
tomorrow's front page.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:32.480
We'll

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.360
put your big photo

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.480
on the front page.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.270
No need.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.320
Tonight is about charity,

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.350
not me.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:42.660
Got it.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.750
Cheng Ao, over here.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.330
Mrs. Shen.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.610
Miss Lin.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.360
This is an authentic work by Liang Qichao.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:53.790
Miss Lin, what a thoughtful donation.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:56.790
On behalf of the hosts,
thank you for your generosity.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.000
Lin Siyun,

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.240
given your family's situation,
why do this?

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.710
If this piece is truly valuable,

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.110
you should keep it for household expenses.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.670
I'm just being practical.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:06.320
Unless

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.850
you're trying to win Aunt Nan's favor.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:08.650
Yingying,

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.030
never question others' good deeds.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.050
Miss Lin wouldn't act
without careful thought.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:15.510
How do you know her so well?

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.920
I'm her lawyer,

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.220
and she's my client.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.000
A lawyer knows their client.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.800
Nothing wrong with that, right?

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.790
Miss Shen is right.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.860
I truly don't have
anything impressive to show,

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.440
but I never intended
to live off this calligraphy either.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.590
As for

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.930
pleasing Mrs. Shen—

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.030
of course.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.940
Everyone here tonight,

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.070
man or woman,

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.440
high or low,

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.790
who doesn't want to please

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.720
our gracious, beautiful hostess?

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.450
Siyun, don't take it to heart.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.980
My sister is quite spoiled. I...

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.020
Shut up.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.160
Miss Lin,

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:50.720
I've been following

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.240
your case closely.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.710
I've written an article supporting you,

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.970
published under a pseudonym, of course.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.310
I'd like you to read it sometime

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:59.770
and give me your thoughts.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.190
Remember,

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.950
you're never alone.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.750
Many educated women of status around me

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:07.080
are all supporting you.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.440
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.080
So many little schemes,

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.960
not only for Aunt Nan,

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.100
but for men as well.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.650
Are you talking about me?

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.650
Exactly.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.120
Pillager,

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.520
won't you invite me to dance?

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:33.360
Where are you going?

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.070
Going home.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.390
Don't be mad.

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:37.270
If you want to dance,

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:38.150
I'll dance with you.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:38.870
Get lost.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.400
Aunt Nan, how should we

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.480
deal with Yingying?

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:44.960
She's being

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.290
so disrespectful to me.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.460
That's because your dad spoiled her.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:00.550
Thank you.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.270
I should thank you.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.600
This time when we're dancing,

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.520
you at least look me in the eyes.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.230
What? Looking you in the eyes?

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.590
I said I should thank you.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:17.810
This time when we're dancing,

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.540
you at least look me in the eyes.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.170
How did I look at you last time we danced?

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.800
Show me.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.570
That's because
I didn't know you well before.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:46.400
It's okay.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.480
From now on,

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.690
there will be plenty of time

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:53.040
for you to get to know me better.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:05.370
Zhaoyuan,

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.410
are you planning to join the army?

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:08.960
Yes.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:10.640
If the Japanese

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.460
dare to cross the Huangpu River,

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.640
I'll fight every single one of them.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.370
But that would be very dangerous.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:19.720
It is dangerous,

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.270
but we can't be bullied anymore.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.200
The foreigners just
send 3,000 or 5,000 men,

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.550
and we get occupied,

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.810
followed by ceding territory
and paying indemnities.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.160
We need to make the world

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.070
see China in a new light.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:36.640
Hearing you talk like this,

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.040
I feel somewhat ashamed.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.860
All I think about every day
is family affairs.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:42.290
There's nothing wrong

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.070
with caring about your family.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.380
Joining the army
is just my personal choice.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.110
You can have your own goals too.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.580
Zhaoyuan,

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.680
you're quite different
from my other classmates.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.790
May I draw you?

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.450
Just don't make me look ugly.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.560
Then I won't.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.010
I was just kidding.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.720
Go ahead.

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.150
-Don't laugh.
-I'm sorry.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:14.409
Take a look. Did I make you look ugly?

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.690
Do you want the truth or a lie?

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:22.060
The truth, of course.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.280
This is

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.880
even better

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.120
than the real me.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:33.650
Yi,

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:35.400
you drew Zhaoyuan's eyes so beautifully.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.630
Can you draw one of me too?

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.360
Sure,

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:39.000
just a moment.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.110
See?

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.739
I'm not the only one praising you.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.000
You just said

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:46.650
you only care about

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.219
your family affairs,

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.000
but turns out you're quite the artist,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.960
drawing so well.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.560
Couldn't this become your goal?

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.190
In the future, my goal is

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.720
to be a soldier, to fight.

00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:59.190
And yours could be

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.880
to become a great artist.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.800
Fine. Whatever you say.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:06.580
Come on.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.420
Thank you.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.100
Once the trial begins,

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:56.190
there will definitely
be more attention and criticism.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.800
When that happens, try not to read

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.060
the reports about you.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.230
There will be all kinds of opinions.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.270
I know you're straightforward,

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.400
and asking you not to look

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.110
isn't because
I'm worried about your feelings,

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.970
but if you respond to each attack,

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:11.440
you'll give those who want to
see you fail exactly what they want.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.440
It's not worth it.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.080
Then what should I do?

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:17.190
Not respond at all?

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.520
If you have any ideas,

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.770
you can discuss with me.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.980
Focus on the positive things.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.710
Like how much

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.800
Mrs. Shen admired you last night.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:30.760
True.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.960
I never expected Mrs. Shen

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:35.590
to be such an open-minded woman.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.480
She even organized a women's group

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:39.920
to support my lawsuit.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.330
Because you deserve it.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.190
Where are those letters

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:50.520
and diaries of your father you mentioned?

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.470
I have them ready.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.840
Here are

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.890
my father's diaries and letters.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:36:59.630
Good.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.190
My Lady.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.850
Madam's gone to the hospital.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:09.000
What happened?

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.400
They said it's her heart.

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:22.960
[Zhongde Hospital]

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:29.900
Mom.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:32.500
Mom, you're awake.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.760
Siyun,

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.420
can you not sue your brother?

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.250
Mom, please don't say that.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.450
Just focus on resting.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.200
Can you please not sue your brother?

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.510
Mom.

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.630
Mom.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.510
Mom.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.490
Can't you just agree with Mom now?

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:24.940
Look at Mom's condition.

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.630
If something happens to her,

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.760
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life!

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.300
Mom.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.920
Mom, I won't sue Lin Jinghan.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:32.880
I won't sue Lin Jinghan.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.840
I won't sue Lin Jinghan.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:54.130
I understand.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:18.360
Mr. Cheng,

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.110
why did you bring me

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.150
up to the rooftop?

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:23.930
I need to be with my mom.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.050
I want to have a word with you.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.110
Sure,

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.630
let's talk.

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:30.990
I also have something to tell you.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.430
Did you see?

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.910
My mom's lying in bed,

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:35.070
hanging between life and death,

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.930
and my sister's still fighting me
ver the inheritance.

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.190
Isn't that heartless?

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.120
Besides, I'm not afraid of going to court.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.080
My father's will

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.110
is clear written in black and white.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.360
I'll definitely win.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.400
Let me remind you,

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:48.600
Miss Lin has many

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.690
letters exchanged with your father.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:53.710
He always supported equality—

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.320
sons and daughters share inheritance.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.410
He supported his daughter's
overseas education

00:39:58.410 --> 00:39:59.630
and her business after returning home.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.480
He specifically told Miss Lin

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.820
that he had set aside funds

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.080
specifically for her business opening.

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.310
But shortly after Mr. Lin's death,

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.910
that money mysteriously disappeared.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.840
Based on this,

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:13.280
first,

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:15.700
I can completely challenge

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.950
the authenticity of your alleged will.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:18.830
Second,

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.250
Miss Lin can sue you for

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.240
illegally seizing the inheritance.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.430
Alright.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.700
Don't tell me all this.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.710
Do you like my sister?

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.630
If you like her, just tell me,

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:33.350
I'll marry her off to you.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:35.180
But there's one condition,

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.610
you'll have to cover some of my debts.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:39.190
Whether I like her

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:40.630
or not

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.400
is none of your business.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.650
Are you even her real brother?

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:46.400
Yes,

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.220
I'm her real brother.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.150
We have the same father and mother.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.780
No doubt.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:50.880
Boss,

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:52.650
I've brought the person.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.180
Director Wang.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:56.760
It's Director Wang.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.970
You know each other?

00:40:59.070 --> 00:40:59.700
Yes, we do.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.840
Let me reintroduce you.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:03.110
That's not necessary.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.370
We've known each other for quite a while.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:06.190
Great,

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:08.780
we're quite familiar with each other too.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.890
By the way, Director,

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:11.600
what illness does Mrs. Lin have?

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.790
Mrs. Lin isn't sick at all.

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:14.100
He told me to say so.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.200
I see.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:22.290
Thank you, Director.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.190
Good for you.

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:32.210
Fine.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.370
Even if

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:38.850
I made that up about my mother,

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.540
you just heard it yourself,

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:42.320
my sister doesn't want anything.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.630
All the property goes to me.

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:45.160
She's the concerned party,

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:47.270
and you have to follow her wish.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.760
I really can't.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.070
Mr. Lin,

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:53.900
this case is going to trial.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:58.400
Are you just looking for trouble?

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.800
What's wrong with you?

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.400
Are you just...

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.330
Who do you think you're talking to?

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:03.230
Don't come any closer!

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:04.060
Stay back!

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:05.250
I've trained, you know.

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.960
Aren't you guys lawyers?

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:09.330
Mr. Cheng is a lawyer.

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.890
I'm not.

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:12.950
What do you do then?

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.370
My name is Cheng,

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.760
from the Zeng's.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.430
You better check it out.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.430
It's the same Zeng you owe money to.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.670
Boss,

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.230
what's it gonna be—arm or leg?

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.280
Ask Mr. Lin.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.880
Mr. Lin,

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.070
pick one.

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:31.380
Arm or leg?

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.030
I'm asking you. Arm or leg?

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:39.970
Sorry about that, Mr. Lin.

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:40.830
It went off accidentally.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.430
I'll settle.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.120
Mr. Cheng,

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:45.450
I...

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.690
I'll never bully my sister again.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:47.720
I'll give her back her share

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.050
of the estate right now.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.480
Is that okay with you?

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:55.870
I'm okay if you say it's okay.

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.280
It's up to you.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.130
Okay. It's okay with me.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.210
Well, if there's nothing else,

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:02.580
I'll be leaving now.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.890
Look at him—scared stiff like a fool.
