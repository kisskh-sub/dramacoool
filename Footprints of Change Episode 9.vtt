00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.810
[Episode 9]

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:47.759
Mr. Cheng,

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.890
a gentleman is waiting for you inside.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:56.910
I've made coffee for you.

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.759
No sugar.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.010
What happened?

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.610
You've fallen out with Dalun?

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.740
Why do you say that?

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.120
Don't you know that Kang Kaisheng
is Zeng Dalun's henchman?

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.680
Kang Kaisheng is Zeng Dalun's henchman?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.240
Yes.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.680
Shen Yiqun arrested Kang Kaisheng by night

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.870
and reported it to the Nanjing government.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.470
The government immediately issued an order

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.400
to treat Kang Kaisheng as a rebel.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.410
By the time Zeng Dalun arrived,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.829
Kang Kaisheng had been sent to Nanjing.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Now even if Zeng Dalun claims

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.660
that Kang Kaisheng is his man,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.150
the Nanjing government wouldn't
admit their mistake.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.520
Kang Kaisheng is doomed.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.840
Shen Yiqun said

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.130
you and he are on the same side,

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.120
and you two worked together
to arrest Kang Kaisheng.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.840
You can't take Shen Yiqun's words

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.910
seriously.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.840
Well done, bro.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.250
You're playing politics now.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.750
If you have any
inside political information,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.350
tell me at the first time.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.600
But you should know

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.450
playing politics isn't that easy.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.190
Whether you

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.590
work with Shen Yiqun

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.280
or with Zeng Dalun,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.730
you have to be careful.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.500
I won't work with anyone.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.550
You are different now.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.240
You won't even be honest with me now.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.210
Fine.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.750
I understand.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.000
Director.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.470
Siyun.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.870
These two say they're
from the Health Department

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.930
and want to see you.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.430
Please come with me to my office.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.030
No need.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.710
We've received reports.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.840
Sinan Maternity Hospital is suspected
of illegal medical practice

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.680
and violations of health regulations.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.210
Some of your practices even
violated ethical standards.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.070
We have decided

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.520
to order your hospital
to cease operations immediately

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.980
for legal rectification.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.120
The reopening time

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.720
depends on the rectification results.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.190
I have government approval
for my operation.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.790
Who gave you this authority?

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.440
Here is the closure notice.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.050
Read it yourself.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.860
[Notice of Closing]

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.029
Those two people were sent by my father.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.300
He was furious,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.660
and almost tore the house apart.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.420
Why?

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.710
You prescribed
birth control pills for Aunt Nan, right?

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.790
Yes, I did.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.680
He found out.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.159
All these years, he's been hoping that

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.960
he and Aunt Nan could have a baby.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.560
Has your father ever asked

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.490
if Aunt Nan wants to have children?

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.380
Siyun.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.010
I understand your progressive thoughts.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.140
But my father doesn't.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.470
He's very traditional.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.270
Is Aunt Nan okay?

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.610
She is fine.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.640
My father didn't get too angry with her.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.870
Instead, he directed all his anger at you.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.680
Don't worry.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.680
Take

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.680
these days a vacation for yourself.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.800
Take a good rest.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.860
I'll communicate with my father.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.820
I'm glad Aunt Nan is okay.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.610
Shen Yiqun.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.640
Thank you for your concern.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.510
Still worried?

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.150
Yes.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.390
I need to discuss something with you.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.630
The statement on this notice

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.480
about Sinan Hospital

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.980
is completely false.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.480
I didn't do anything illegal.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.270
If we can trace the source
of these rumors,

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.360
and file an appeal,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.510
will Sinan Hospital

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.480
be able to resume business soon?

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.000
Yes.

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.960
But according to my experience,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.120
from filing an appeal
to getting the verdict,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.680
it will take

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.650
at least three months.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.680
Three months?

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.430
If

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.360
you have trouble tracking

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.080
the source of the rumors,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.950
it might take

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.070
half a year.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.200
So long?

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.390
Besides,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.210
if there are many cases in court,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.480
it might take ten months

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.820
or even a year.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.680
How can I keep my hospital running if so?

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.770
My funds won't last ten months.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.430
I have so many doctors and nurses,

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.480
and medical supplies.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.150
However,

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.670
I do have a quicker solution.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.470
Why are you so annoying?

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.159
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.390
Hello.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.650
I'm looking for Director Shen.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.980
Director Shen isn't seeing anyone today.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.210
I told you already.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.540
Director Shen isn't seeing anyone today.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.130
Then please give this photo

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.659
to him.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.830
Director.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.190
Come in.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.950
Get out.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.720
Miss Lin,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.930
what do you mean?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.720
With Director Shen's intervention,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.960
I believe the hospital's crisis

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.560
will be resolved soon.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.600
You're threatening me?

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.310
Director Shen, you're overreacting.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.240
It's just a matter of reciprocity.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:45.820
Besides,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.190
about Aunt Nan's birth control issue,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.860
I hope you can stop interfering with it.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.060
You want to meddle in my family affairs?

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.510
Then, I have no choice but
to talk to Mayor Zhu

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.970
about his family matters.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.650
Thank you for your understanding,
Director Shen.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.920
Dalun.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.920
What are you doing here?

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.280
You want to talk to the director?

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.320
He probably won't be here for a while.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.190
Why don't you come to my office first?

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.270
Let's have a chat.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.330
Kang Kaisheng's incident

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.909
was truly a case of friendly fire.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.880
He's too much like a Communist.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:37.630
Think about

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.870
those articles he wrote,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.669
and the things he did.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.960
He looked exactly like
a rebel sympathizer.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.909
I didn't know he was your man.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.000
Dalun,

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.120
although he's been sent to Nanjing now,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.750
don't worry.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.480
I'll go there myself later

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.200
to clear things up,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.600
and bring him back to you.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:52.480
Shen Yiqun.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.490
What are you most afraid of?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.290
What am I most afraid of?

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.870
Given the current situation,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.720
what I fear most is that

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.320
Japan would launch
a full-scale invasion of China.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.630
People will be homeless refugees
at that time.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:11.440
Imagine it.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.160
When that time comes,

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.480
how much will the people suffer?

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.480
I'm most afraid of venomous snakes.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.760
Tigers and lions don't scare me at all.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.000
But venomous snakes

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.440
always live in dark, damp places.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.770
They will bite you
when you least expect it

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.240
and kill you easily.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:37.910
Indeed.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.150
Yiqun.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:39.910
Director.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.080
What are you doing here?

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.000
I'm working here.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.270
I saw Dalun here.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.870
So, I came in to chat with him.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.360
You two know each other?

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.350
We've known each other since childhood.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.410
We are old friends.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.200
Altough

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.390
you are friends,

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.150
let me formally introduce you.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.270
Dalun has joined

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.320
our department's special action team.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.870
You two should work closely together
from now on.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:59.630
What's more,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.870
even Mr. Dai thinks highly of him.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.670
Take good care of him.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.070
Well, well!

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.340
Dalun,

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:07.810
congratulations!

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:08.840
If you need anything,

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.670
just let me know.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.400
I'll fully cooperate with you.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.300
Thanks for your kindness.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.600
Now that the Director is here,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.390
you'd report to him.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.550
I'll head back first.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.200
Come to my place for tea
after you're done.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.670
Okay.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.740
I'll leave, Director.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.790
Good!

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.860
My method worked out, right?

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.030
Thank you.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:46.280
What's next?

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.230
♪ What we've loved, what we've said ♪

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.880
♪ Won't be swept away by wind or rain ♪

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.490
♪ What we've suffered, what we've missed ♪

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.400
♪ Shapes the loneliness of our parting ♪

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.930
♪ What we've loved, what we've said ♪

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.990
♪ The bonds of this life that never fade ♪

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:20.790
♪ I'll treasure what you gave me ♪

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.520
What's next?

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.630
♪ That brightness in the darkness ♪

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.750
What happens next

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.330
is very important.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.240
♪ I'll treasure what you gave me ♪

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.500
I'm having dinner with Mr. Zeng tonight.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:46.400
♪ That brightness in the darkness ♪

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.150
You're all busy.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.480
But you came to celebrate my birthday.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.550
Thank you.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.870
It's our pleasure.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.360
Our friendship

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.120
has lasted over 30 years now.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.800
He wasn't even born at that time.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.740
Does your father know
about our relationship?

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.870
What relationship?

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.310
Why are you making it sound like

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.770
we have something to hide?

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.700
Will your father like

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.440
the gift I prepared for him?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.750
Don't worry.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.030
He'll definitely like it.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.360
He loves drinking tea,

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.500
not to mention that

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.390
it's your gift.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.480
Don't be nervous.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.300
It isn't your first time here.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.440
And you've met him before.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.150
It's different this time.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.790
We came in arm in arm.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.230
It'll get better if you come more often.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.060
So,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.800
whatever happens,

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.260
let us support each other.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.180
Father.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:12:59.960
Ao.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.240
Dr. Lin.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.190
Come in.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.300
Please, come in.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.390
Mr. Zeng.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.390
Wish you a happy birthday.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.750
Thank you.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.120
Look,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.150
our family

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.510
has a lawyer.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.470
In the future,

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.750
we will have a doctor.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:21.840
Today,

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.920
I'm blessed with double happiness.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.980
Congratulations.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:26.400
Father,

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.440
Siyun brought you a gift.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.070
That's very kind of you.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.510
What's this?

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.950
Tea.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.360
Foreign tea. Look.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.110
It even has foreign letters.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.800
Put it away quickly.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.090
I told you he would like it.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.150
Cheng Ao, come here.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:13:59.930
Father.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.610
Thank you, Father.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:06.670
What are you thanking me for?

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.840
It's not for you.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.630
Take it.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:14.630
It's from Father.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.030
Thank you, Mr. Zeng.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.600
It's nothing.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.600
Master, bad news.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.470
A group of people
from the police station are here.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:24.600
Excuse me.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.240
My friend.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.150
May I help you?

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.200
Mr. Zeng,

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.380
someone reported that your son,
Zeng Dalun,

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.210
is hiding and selling opium.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.150
There must be a misunderstanding.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.480
Our family has strictly forbidden

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480
opium trading.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.270
Mr. Zeng,

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.410
this is an order from my senior.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.760
This is a search warrant.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.480
Have you lost your minds?

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.160
Get out of my house now!

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.000
If you don't leave,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.840
I'll pull out my gun.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.600
How dare you!

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:09.750
Step aside!

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:11.450
Young Master Zeng,

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:12.280
Mr. Zeng,

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.410
we came with a search warrant.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.550
If we leave without doing anything,

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.600
we won't be able to report back properly.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.000
I'm sure you understand.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.240
Okay.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.480
Do your job.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.300
But

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.750
today is my birthday.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.330
I've invited many guests.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.130
Our family values our reputation.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.080
If you find nothing,

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.330
the police station

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.670
has to publicly apologize to our family.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.390
Mr. Zeng,

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.790
if we find nothing,

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.030
I will certainly apologize.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.910
And we'll publish

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.250
a front-page apology in the newspaper.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.180
Please proceed.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:51.750
Search!

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:52.790
Hurry up.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:59.050
Over here!

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.440
Did you do this?

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.270
Dad,

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.690
I didn't do it.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.090
Please trust me.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.930
Found it!

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.790
Take it out!

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.630
Let's go!

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:31.550
Take it out!

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.100
Mr. Zeng,

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.630
please

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.010
verify if this is real.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.250
Do what you should do.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.160
Take him away.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.210
It's fine.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.100
I didn't do it anyway.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.200
Alright.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:00.220
I can walk.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.270
Pack up and take him away.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.480
Hurry up!

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.510
Mr. Cheng.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.510
Our law firm has quite a few cases lately.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.550
Could you help us handle some of them?

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.410
Here are the relevant documents.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.400
No problem.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.210
That's what old classmates are for.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.730
You helped me a lot before.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.080
This person has asked me for help.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.160
You were too busy.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:55.960
I recently have

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.070
a similar case.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.600
I'll handle them together.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.870
Alright, leave it to me.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.480
Okay.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:13.550
Cheng Ao,

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.240
when I was paying the fine
at the police station,

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.310
I asked around.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.620
They said a lawyer
named Cheng reported me.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.780
We didn't have any conflict, did we?

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.620
Even though you don't like

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.050
my way of doing things,

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.080
you shouldn't stab me
in the back like this.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.150
You know I work

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.400
for the government.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.390
My reputation is important.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.840
After this incident,

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.960
I've been bribing officials,

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.800
explaining myself and entertaining others.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.120
But I don't even know if these will help.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.110
Shen Yiqun watches me every day.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:55.880
You deliberately

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.940
gave him something to use against me.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.130
Besides, I didn't even do this thing.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.930
Boiling beans,

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.880
with beanstalks as fuel,

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:20.610
the beans

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.260
weep in the pot.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:25.680
We are brothers.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.480
I won't be angry with you.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.380
You're blocking my light.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.440
You had the police

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.170
arrest me at Dad's birthday banquet.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.010
I can also choose not to tell Dad
about it.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.240
Do not let him

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.110
worry about us.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:53.840
He's getting old.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.800
You can see that too, right?

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.450
From now on, you'll be
the head of this family.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.170
And I'll be the second-in-command.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:13.750
Cheng Ao.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.860
We need to stick together.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.720
Cheng Ao.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.350
You're so talented.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.000
Dalun.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.150
I am

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.590
Jinghan.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.270
I've noticed that

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.990
since you returned from the Northeast,

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:30.680
you've become quite famous in Shanghai.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.240
Everyone knows your name.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.830
Your career is really taking off.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:37.640
I heard that you're now

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.680
working at the Revival Society,

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.610
and engaging in the opium trade.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.880
I want to make big money with you.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.720
I graduated from business school,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.510
and I want to follow
in your footsteps, Dalun.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.340
I'll follow your lead.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.270
I will do whatever you want me to do.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.680
Jinghan.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.130
Have a drink.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.410
Let me fill it up.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.480
I actually quite like you.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.570
How should I describe you?

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.310
You're like

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.440
a toothless old dog.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.340
You don't bite,

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.850
but you're still quite intimidating.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.590
I can't help you with work matters.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.720
But if you want to come here for drinks,

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:34.640
it's on me.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.750
Get out.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.830
No visitors for the next 30 minutes.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:58.690
Close the door.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:42.970
Yes.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.900
I did it.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:52.790
Is everything in place?

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:53.880
All set, Director.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.710
Let's go.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.280
This is a search warrant.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:05.270
Take it out.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.000
Cheng Ao.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.270
When I was paying
the fine at the police station,

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.350
I asked around.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.860
I heard it was reported
by a lawyer named Cheng.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.610
You dragged me down,

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.250
trying to tie me to you.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.410
You're too afraid to face
Zeng Dalun yourself

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.880
because he works for Mr. Dai.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:30.430
You're quite shameless.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.030
I admit my method

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.670
is somewhat despicable.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.760
But to make great achievements,

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:41.480
I should use some tactics.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.800
I know Zeng Dalun is
the one who caused you trouble.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.880
You're concerned about Mr. Zeng.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.070
So, you didn't dare scheme against Dalun.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.930
But I have nothing to worry about.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.710
Since we have a common enemy,

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.880
why don't we brothers join forces?

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.070
It's a good thing.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.550
Who said we're brothers?

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.240
No matter what Zeng Dalun did to me,

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.550
it is my own business.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.550
I know.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.960
You grew up together

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.860
and have loyalty between you.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.010
But don't we have
something between us, too?

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:22.790
We did.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.660
Before this incident, we did.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.530
Now, when I look at you,
I just feel disgusted.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.310
Cheng Ao,

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.200
I never thought

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.930
I would hear

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.160
these words from you.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.480
I admit I'm a despicable person.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.130
But without being this way,

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:51.770
how could I ever succeed?

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.390
Once I have power in my hands,

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.320
I'll share it with you.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.070
Bro,

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.790
one of us has to be

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.480
the disgusting one.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.830
Now, I've chosen to be the one.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.680
What right do you have to criticize me?

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.750
Are you crazy?

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.640
Who's crazy?

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.160
Who wants your pathetic power?

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.960
No matter what happens
between you and Zeng Dalun,

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.700
don't get me involved. Got it?

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.200
Understand?

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.710
Director Shen.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:48.240
Mr. Zeng.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:49.290
Mr. Sada.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.790
Your dad refuses to cooperate with us.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.750
He also incited the union workers
to organize strikes.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.200
Do you know all this?

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.200
My dad is quite traditional

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.310
and conservative.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.110
Mr. Zeng.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.680
Can you persuade your dad
to cooperate with us?

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.590
He could make a lot of money.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.790
And we can guarantee your dad's safety.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.110
Your dad has two choices,

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.200
cooperating with us

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:25.000
or being killed by us.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.880
You're threatening me?

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.910
That's not my intention.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.790
We are friends.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.400
So, I'm telling you this.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:39.190
I hope you can consider it.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.960
Why did you ask me to meet at the dock?

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.320
When we were kids,

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.700
we always played here.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.750
When we were young,
Dad didn't allow us to drink

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.410
but we always drank in secret.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:09.620
Remember that time

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.940
when you got drunk and Dad caught you?

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.230
He slapped you so hard
that two of your teeth flew out.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:15.200
Nonsense.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.590
He did slap me.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.510
But my teeth didn't fall out.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.490
Well,

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:23.240
I remember now.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.880
I bought the wine for you.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.070
You did buy it for me

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.430
but I never got to drink it.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.440
You finished it all
before you even got home.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.880
I saved you.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.160
Otherwise, you would've been slapped, too.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.200
Fine, thank you.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.660
Cheng Ao.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.720
About Xiu,

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.280
I didn't tell you the truth.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.200
I know.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:17.230
About Huang Aniu,

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.110
I also lied to you.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.240
I know.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:23.640
But today,

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.340
I need to tell you the truth

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:27.440
and be honest.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:34.090
I do have connections with the Japanese.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.740
They now wield considerable
influence in Shanghai.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.400
I can only befriend them
and avoid making enemies.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.720
It allows me to make money

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.720
without any risk.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.320
I hope you understand that

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.770
and help me convince Dad

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.990
to cooperate with the Japanese.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.990
What do you think?

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.160
Forget about Communism.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.000
If you continue down that path,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.730
it will only lead to your death.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:05.750
Besides,

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.010
our family business

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.020
is only in the French Concession.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.150
Soon after the Japanese come,

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.550
the French will all flee.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.960
Have you ever had Japanese food?

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.440
Tomorrow,

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.720
I'll invite Sada

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.030
to have a meal with us.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.270
Sada is a nice person.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.430
And

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.720
when you

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.440
put the sashimi in your mouth,

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.350
you will find the taste

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.070
is amazing.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.840
What are you doing?

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:55.680
Where are you going?

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.480
Zeng Dalun.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.870
We're not brothers anymore.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.400
Why?

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.680
Cheng Ao!

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.510
Come back!

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.570
Help me massage my back.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:17.900
Master.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.890
Mr. Cheng and Miss Lin are here.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.310
Please show them in.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.170
Yes, Master.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.000
Father.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.270
Dr. Lin.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.730
Father, please don't move.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:37.110
I'm sorry.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.640
I'm not feeling well.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.160
Please excuse my negligence.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.220
Please have a seat.

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:43.270
Mr. Zeng.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.160
You don't need to attend to me.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.510
Have you seen a doctor?

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.620
Would you like me to recommend
some Western doctors?

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.110
No need.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.400
It's an old ailment.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.480
A few doses of Chinese medicine will help.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.240
Miss Lin.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.680
Come sit in my room.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.590
I want you to check on my baby.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.450
Okay.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:02.240
Yes.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.160
Keep Dr. Lin company for a while.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:09.610
Take it slow.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.410
Come, have a seat.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.710
Tell me the truth.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.590
Did you report Dalun?

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.070
No.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.580
Reporting him wouldn't be wrong.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.200
I just don't want to see

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.110
you two turning against each other.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.030
You lost your parents when you were young.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.030
I've always treated you as my own son.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.200
I hoped you two

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.310
would get along well

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.950
and support each other.

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:11.139
Dalun is a jerk

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:12.840
who deserves to die.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:17.880
But I hope the one who kills him

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.040
wouldn't be you.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:24.650
Do you understand?

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:28.949
Have a rest, Father.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.880
Dad.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:44.070
Stand up!

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.320
Are you still hanging around
with the Japanese?

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.280
Cut the crap.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.280
You did business

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.630
with the Japanese in Changchun,

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.160
selling local goods to them

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.910
and bringing Japanese products back here.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.570
You think I don't know?

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:20.740
I did it to make money.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.590
Nonsense!

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:25.470
Besides doing business,

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:28.670
what else did you do?

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:29.480
Nothing.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.340
You worked with Huang Aniu

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.420
trafficking opium

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.950
and had your gang members

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:39.560
attack Cheng Ao,

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.220
right?

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.960
Zeng Dalun,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.600
you're playing with fire.
Do you realize that?

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:05.230
Dad.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.840
I'm working for the Revival Society now.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:08.680
I need

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.320
money to get things done here.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.550
How can I rise step by step
without money?

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.590
But you should not
collude with the Japanese.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.030
That's my bottom line.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.870
I'm not trying to collude with them.

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:18.580
They came to me first.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.930
You incited the union workers to strike.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:23.030
They gave you two options.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.630
Cooperate with them

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:26.890
and make a lot of money.

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:27.790
Or,

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.320
they'll kill you.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.480
Let them try.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.230
If I am frightened,

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:37.830
I'm not worthy to be your dad.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.150
Dad.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.230
In my opinion,

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.110
you are too conservative.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:50.230
Why are you so stubborn?

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:51.880
You've taught us since we were young

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.010
we should not make enemies
with forces stronger than us.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.710
You made the union workers strike.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.030
The Japanese didn't punish you.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.070
Instead, they want to cooperate with you.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.360
What a great opportunity!

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.230
I think

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.920
the Japanese influence in Shanghai

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.890
is getting stronger and stronger.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.710
You'll have to face the Japanese
sooner or later.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:10.630
Better sooner than later.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.750
We need to use

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:14.850
the Japanese influence

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.510
to become the number one group
in Shanghai.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.400
Get out!

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:28.270
Dad.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.670
After more than 20 years,

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:31.710
your still have so much strength.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:32.990
Alright.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:34.710
It won't be long

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.010
before we see whose judgment is correct.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.670
Old man.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.670
Don't go out these days unless necessary.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:48.630
Take some men with you when you go out.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.160
Be careful not to be killed.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.590
Hello, this is Pingzheng Law Firm.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:18.440
Mr. Cheng,

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:21.520
Master is feeling unwell.
He's asking you to come over.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
What's wrong with Father?

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.710
Is he okay?

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.690
He said he has important matters
to tell you.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.110
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.090
Master.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.320
Mr. Cheng is

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.510
waiting at the door.

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:52.670
I'll step out first.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:54.270
Call me if you need anything.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.170
Yanhong.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:58.190
Sit down.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:01.540
What I'm about to discuss

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:04.360
concerns you.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:08.280
Father.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.510
Ao,

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.760
have a seat.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.720
I'll tell you something.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.810
Write it down.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:28.950
I want to change my will.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.200
All my assets,

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.760
houses,

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:51.050
and the land in my hometown

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:56.510
which were originally intended for
my sole heir, Zeng Dalun,

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.770
will be divided into four equal parts.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.510
One part

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:06.570
goes to my eldest son, Zeng Dalun.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:09.480
One part

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:15.390
goes to my adopted son, Cheng Ao.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:22.590
One part

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.430
goes to Xiao Yanhong

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:32.420
and her young son.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:43.060
The last part

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.080
should be donated to my hometown

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:48.620
to build schools

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.090
and charity houses.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.590
Thank you, Master.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.350
Have you written everything down?

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:07.150
After it's finished,

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.770
I'll sign it.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.600
Everything is noted.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.990
I'll take my leave now, Father.
