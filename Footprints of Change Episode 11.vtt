his son with his body.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.550
Now they want me to leave.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.710
My last refuge

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.090
will soon be gone too.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.010
Where can I go?

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.040
Do I really have to leave?

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.160
Will Zhaoyuan be able
to find me when he returns?

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.630
No.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:26.650
I must stay in Shanghai.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.450
[Ms. Yi, please move out
as soon as possible.]

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.060
I have nothing to worry about anyway.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.670
Worst case,
I'll jump into the Huangpu River.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.800
My wife and children

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.080
don't run any factories

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.480
and aren't capitalists.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.680
The state will have to take care of them.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.750
Go ahead and jump.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.320
Who are you trying to scare?

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:49.440
Fan.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.060
Yang.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.010
Sit down.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.160
Mind your attitude.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.760
We didn't come here today

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.390
to argue, right?

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.070
Let's hear what Minister Wen has to say.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.840
Mr. Fan.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.270
I remember during the Five-Anti Campaign,

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.070
because of the back taxes issue,

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.790
you threatened to jump off a building.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.840
That was Shanghai's tallest building.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.720
I recall the police even came.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.140
You remember that, don't you?

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.120
I don't remember.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.920
I don't remember, Minister Wen.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.830
Minister Wen.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.600
You're a reasonable person.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.000
I came from poverty.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.480
I've worked hard my whole life

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.080
to finally gain some assets.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:39.390
And now

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.670
you want public-private partnerships.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.000
I just can't accept it.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:45.920
Stop making excuses.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.090
Where did your wealth come from?

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.600
From exploiting workers.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.440
Now we're liberated.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.200
You need to change your thinking

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.550
and earn your own living.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:55.450
Public-private partnership

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.410
is the inevitable trend

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.830
and it's also providing a way out for you.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:58.750
I might as well jump off a building then.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:59.390
Jump!

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.320
You just won't listen to reason, will you?

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:01.910
Fan!

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:02.670
Yang Xue'an!

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.870
What are you doing?

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.330
I invited everyone here today

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.910
to speak freely.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.440
We can't label people

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.970
just because they have different opinions.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.960
Mr. Fan,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.840
please calm down.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:34.590
Come.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.730
Please have a seat.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.170
I've invited you all here today

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.670
to speak freely.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.390
Don't hold anything back.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.600
Share whatever thoughts you have.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.360
Our policy

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.000
toward national capitalists like you

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.360
is to adopt a moderate,

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.310
compensated buyout approach.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.670
It fully considers everyone's interests.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.210
You can all think about it.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.060
Comparing your business operations

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.320
and profits

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.630
in old China and in New China,

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.210
which period has been better for you?

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.940
New China is certainly better.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.820
The Communist Party is good.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.120
Before liberation,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.440
the KMT made a mess of things.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.370
It was impossible to make a living.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.570
I support Minister Wen.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.960
What does everyone think?

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.870
Yes, we support Minister Wen.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:57.730
We support him.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.010
I've invited everyone here today

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.700
because I hope

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.720
you'll all express your thoughts.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.880
We'll solve each issue one by one

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.140
and implement solutions step by step

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.870
to give everyone peace of mind.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.000
Minister Wen, this way please.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.530
Mr. Fu, you've got a new car?

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.000
Yes, Minister Wen.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.120
To be honest with you,

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.200
this is the latest model,

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.090
the only one in all of Shanghai.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.500
I can lend it to you for a few days,

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.480
so you can try it out.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.870
Lend it to me for a few days?

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.160
Are you trying to bribe me?

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.210
No, no, not at all.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.200
I heard you were in the military before

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.550
and really enjoyed driving.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:38.480
It's just a loan,

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.320
not a gift.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.550
Mr. Fu, you're very well-informed.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.630
Who told you I can drive?

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.720
I forgot.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.200
Fine.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.120
I'll treat you to dinner sometime.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.330
Seems you need to get to know me better.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:55.630
Goodbye.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.030
Minister Wen, let me see you out.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.670
I won't lend it anymore.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.270
Minister Wen! Minister Wen!

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.349
Yi! Yi!

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.260
Did you tear this?

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.810
Yes, I did.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.690
You're so bold.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.960
Who told you to tear it?

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.890
I'm not leaving.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.680
Don't talk about it here.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.680
Let's go to my place to talk.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.480
Hurry.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.290
I just escorted two officials out.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.350
If they won't let you stay, then move out.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.220
I have so many vacant villas.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.770
You can stay in any of them.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.180
Zihe.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.790
You're a CPPCC Municipal Committee member.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.920
A leader
of the Industry and Commerce Association.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.320
You...

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.350
Don't talk here.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.400
Let's go inside to talk.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.110
Hurry up.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.590
You're too impulsive.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.640
Calm down.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.240
Didn't you say
Mayor Chen thinks highly of you?

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.260
Can you help me report this issue?

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.270
You really think

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.480
my words carry any weight

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.240
with those high-ranking officials?

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.000
Let me tell you.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Not just me.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.240
Even the most prestigious
business tycoons in Shanghai

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.240
couldn't help you

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.200
with this matter.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.070
Isn't the Communist Party
supposed to serve the people?

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.470
Am I not one of the people?

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.720
That portrait
you painted for me last time, I...

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.720
What are you doing?

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.510
The staff downstairs
told me to move everything out.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.720
It's too early for that.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.790
Go tell your supervisors downstairs

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.720
that we haven't finished our business yet.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.120
We're not moving out now.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.150
We'll move according to schedule.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.000
Thank you.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.000
Thank you.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.160
See that?

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.640
So jumpy.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:58.890
Scared me to death.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.970
Let me analyze this for you.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.070
Me, a capitalist.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.480
Zhaoyuan,
a reactionary government official.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.510
You, a petty bourgeois.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.570
You know
what petty bourgeois means, right?

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.960
A petty bourgeois intellectual.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.380
Originally, you belonged
to the common people.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.960
But unfortunately,

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.070
you happen to be the wife
of a KMT official.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.270
That changes everything.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.680
So you've become

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.960
distanced from the people.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.820
I've heard Mayor Chen's reports.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.970
He's a learned and capable man.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.720
I don't believe they would
practice guilt by association.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.680
Mayor Chen

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.740
is certainly an outstanding leader.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.270
Including the one
who came to our club today,

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.310
Minister Wen.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.330
They are all excellent officials.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.270
The key issue is the people
implementing policies below them.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.310
Their abilities vary greatly,
as you've seen.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.880
You said Minister Wen is a good official?

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.680
Yes.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.130
Where does he work?

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.170
I'll go find him.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.110
Forget it.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.160
Minister Wen
is such a high-ranking official.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.400
How would he have time
to personally handle your small matter?

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.070
He would definitely
delegate it to his subordinates.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.640
I still want to try.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.400
Yi, please listen to me.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.590
Leave Shanghai as soon as possible.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.610
I have investments
in both Hong Kong and Singapore.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.030
You won't get rich there,

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.110
but you'll have enough

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.440
to live comfortably.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.080
I'm not leaving.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.600
I appreciate your kindness.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.110
But I need to stay here
and wait for news from Zhaoyuan.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.310
To protect our country,

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.110
[August 1937, Shanghai suburbs]

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.880
to protect our loved ones,

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.400
today,

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.370
we're heading to the battlefield.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.350
We might go to battle today

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.750
and not return tomorrow.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.480
But as soldiers,

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.000
as sons of China,

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.630
we face death without fear.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.080
I once personally
sent Zhaoyuan to the battlefield.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.200
[August 1945, Chongqing]

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.060
Before he left,

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.080
he promised he would return.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.000
And he kept his promise.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.590
After the victory,

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.670
we reunited in Chongqing.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.560
Yi!

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.750
Yi!

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.920
Zhaoyuan!

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.240
Afterwards,

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.590
we got married soon.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.490
He told me then,

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.030
we would never be apart again.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.920
Let's go take a look.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.720
Wait a moment.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.110
Mrs. Zhou.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.020
Please have a seat.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.510
Could you take another photo for us?

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.200
Sure.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.270
Listen for my count.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.680
3, 2, 1.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.920
Smile!

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.750
Later,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.440
he went on a mission.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.590
The last time we met...

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.680
Zhaoyuan promised me

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
that he would definitely come back.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.010
I will wait for him here.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.030
Yi.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.000
Zhaoyuan has been missing for five years.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.840
Five years.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.140
If he were still alive,

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.170
no matter where he is,

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.370
he would have found a way to contact you.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.480
Stop waiting.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.270
Look at the state you're in.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.070
I can't bear to see you like this.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:34.920
Until I see his body,

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.010
I believe he's still alive.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.160
I'll manage to get by.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.720
[Shanghai Municipal People's Government]

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.270
Qing.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.920
I wouldn't come to you
unless absolutely necessary.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.200
Let's not talk here.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.450
Yi Yi, why are you coming to me?

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:30.840
I want to ask

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.960
if you have any news about your brother.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.220
I don't have a brother.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.980
Even if you don't want to acknowledge it,

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:42.960
your records

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.160
will always show Zhou Zhaoyuan's name.

Who do you think you are?

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.000
What right do you
have to come to me?

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.960
Without you people,

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.070
my life would be peaceful.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.160
Qing.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.550
You know your brother as well as I do.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.010
He has noble character

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.550
and is a hero
who fought against Japanese invasion.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:10.680
He's not a bad person.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.410
I never said he was a bad person.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.590
You came to me

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.120
just to make me
feel miserable, didn't you?

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.920
Who are you looking for?

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:39.080
I'm here to report
a situation to the supervisor.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.140
Here are my documents.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.310
Come in.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.180
My surname is Fang.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.000
This is Mr. Yang.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.240
He's also in charge of Fu Zihe's company.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.640
He handles your case too.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.010
You can discuss your matters with him.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:08.040
Please sit down.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.750
The union suddenly
notified me of my dismissal.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:17.880
I don't understand.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.660
I need an explanation.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:24.590
About your situation,

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.140
the organization is aware of it.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.070
However,

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.080
with the merger and restructuring

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:30.810
of the plant,

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.880
personnel changes are inevitable.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.750
You don't need to worry too much.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:35.400
Right?

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:37.930
Besides, someone like you...

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.640
What kind of person am I?

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.590
As the wife of a KMT official,

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.270
you're not short of money, are you?

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.880
You can live well without working.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.810
What's the rush?

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.350
Although my husband
worked for the Nationalist government,

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.810
he was an honest official.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.070
We don't own a house.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.270
We've always been renting.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.530
And we have no savings.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.480
I've been working
ever since he disappeared.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.720
Now you're taking away
my opportunity to work,

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.880
making me homeless

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.410
and unemployed, is that it?

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.670
I understand your concerns.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.200
But Shanghai now

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.800
doesn't lack
intellectuals and technicians.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.480
The Northwest needs people.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.550
My personal suggestion is

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:15.160
that you

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.540
go work as a technician
at the wool mill in the Northwest.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:19.670
How does that sound?

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.550
You want to drive me out of Shanghai?

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:26.030
Comrade Fang.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:26.960
Let me ask you again.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.290
What kind of person am I?

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.800
Am I not an intellectual?

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.280
Am I not someone
your Communist Party claims to unite with?

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.070
Even if my husband

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:35.640
once worked
for the Nationalist government.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.510
But he was an honest official
and an anti-Japanese hero.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.750
You don't get to decide who's a hero.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.350
My husband nearly died.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.000
The bullet is still in his body.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.650
How dare you say he's not a hero?

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:45.750
If you keep pestering me...

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.790
-I won’t talk to you.
-You must apologize to my husband.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:47.510
Why should I apologize?

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.200
Apologize!

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.160
Calm down.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:50.680
Everyone calm down.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.750
Ms. Yi.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.400
Don't be so agitated.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.510
Sit down.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.120
Have a seat.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.750
We truly don't know much

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.570
about your husband.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:14.880
If he really is an anti-Japanese hero,

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.260
then I'll formally apologize
on behalf of the organization.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.430
I want him to apologize.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:20.880
Why should I apologize to you?

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.790
Listen to me.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.430
But you and your husband
are separate matters.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.160
Sending you to work in the Northwest

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.640
was just a suggestion from Mr. Yang.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.690
You should trust
the Party and the organization.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.250
You don't need to say more.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.590
If you can't resolve this,

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.200
I'll go to your superiors.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.270
If your superiors can't solve it,

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.590
I'll go to Mayor Chen.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.660
If Mayor Chen won't see me,

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.060
then I'll go to Beijing.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.320
I'll find Premier Zhou and Chairman Mao.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.060
There must be someone
who will listen to reason.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.420
Yi Yi, are you crazy?

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:01.440
Do you know where you are?

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.000
How dare you talk to Mr. Yang like that?

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:05.790
He's very fierce.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.140
He will really arrest people.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.610
But they shouldn't
talk about your brother like that.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.760
Even then, it's not okay.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:28.350
It's not okay.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.070
Come in.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.500
Excuse me.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.060
Are you Director Fang's supervisor?

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:04.960
Yes, I am.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.140
Here are my documents.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.340
Please have a seat.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.440
Please sit down.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.350
May I sit?

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.750
Of course.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.030
You're an artist,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.530
a national talent.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.170
Have some water.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.310
Thank you.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.660
Director Fang told me
about your situation.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.110
So you know

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.170
they want to drive me out of Shanghai?

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.240
I think you've misunderstood them.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.900
No one wants to drive you away.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.590
Professionals like you,

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:05.570
especially

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.350
female professionals,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.590
are highly valued.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:12.960
Mr. Yang was just making a suggestion.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.880
You see,

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.200
Shanghai is China's largest city.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.080
It was already overcrowded
before Liberation.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.620
Having too many excellent talents
like you concentrated here...

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.770
I just want to ask

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.590
if my husband wasn't an official
of the Nationalist government,

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.240
would you treat me this way?

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.400
This matter has nothing
to do with your husband.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.240
We know that

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.640
although your husband was an official
of the Nationalist government,

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.640
he repeatedly

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.430
distinguished himself in battle
during the war against Japan.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.090
He's a hero of the resistance,

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.270
a man worthy of respect.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.100
After Japan's surrender,

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.560
he has no record of misconduct.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:54.410
Thank you for saying that.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.340
My husband is currently missing.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.350
I'm waiting for him in Shanghai.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.160
Don't worry.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:07.270
No one will force you to leave Shanghai.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.510
Are these your paintings?

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:17.160
Yes.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.640
But have you considered?

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.920
What if...

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:25.030
I mean, hypothetically speaking,

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:26.690
if you were to leave Shanghai,

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:28.960
perhaps your artistic career

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:30.960
could expand significantly.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.790
You don't understand what Shanghai

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.310
means to me at all.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.970
All my happiness and suffering

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.960
are deeply connected to this city.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:43.790
Indeed.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.870
People like you

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:49.190
could never understand.

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.720
Where is Mayor Chen's office?

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.390
I need to see him.

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:07.930
Mayor Chen is away on business.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.730
Then I'll wait for him to return.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.180
I'll wait for justice.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.000
Comrade Su.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.330
I heard you had an argument with Mr. Yang.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.680
Yes.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:31.680
You're quite brave.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.070
The organization knows
you have no relatives in Shanghai.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.440
But arranging a new job for you

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.830
will take some time.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.920
If you have any financial difficulties,

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.200
you can always
ask the organization for help.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.800
I appreciate your kindness.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.550
Yang.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:52.150
Director.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.510
I heard that you at the meeting

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.970
slammed the table
and argued with Minister Wen.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.680
In front of so many people,

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.000
that was really inappropriate.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:01.500
Yes.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:03.010
Apologize.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.130
Apologize to Minister Wen.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.030
Minister.

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:10.040
At that time,

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.910
my words were inappropriate

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.650
and my behavior was excessive.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:14.810
I apologize to you.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.550
I'm sorry.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.590
However,

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:26.870
Minister,

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.770
according to some union comrades,

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.720
these illegal capitalists

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.240
are showing signs of fleeing abroad.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.820
They will likely transfer their funds.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.960
If we don't stop them,

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.420
there will definitely be serious problems.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.770
Transferring funds and fleeing abroad?

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.200
Who are they?

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.510
As far as I know,

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:45.400
Fu Zihe, Mr. Fu,

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:47.160
Sun Wenjie, Mr. Sun,

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:48.550
Liang Wei, Mr. Liang,

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.030
Yang Liye, Mr. Yang,

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.110
and other bosses.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.640
Is this information accurate?

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.500
As far as I know,

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.780
it is accurate.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:58.720
You said union comrades told you this.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.110
Which union comrades?

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.200
Some

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.820
union comrades reported it.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.980
As for who exactly,

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.540
I don't recall.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.150
Such an important matter,

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.929
how could you not remember?

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.080
How about this, Yang?

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.150
You should go to the union

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.110
and get them to clear it up.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.960
Find out who said this

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.880
and get all the details.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:23.510
Okay.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.560
Minister.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.969
I'll get to work now.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.710
Did you see that?

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.110
Yang's prejudice against capitalists

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.639
is deeply ingrained in him.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.780
He's not suitable
for his current position.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.500
We should replace him
with a more experienced comrade.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.710
That's a bit much.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.200
Comrade Yang has a firm political stance.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.150
He's also well-versed in theory.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.010
He's quite suitable for this job.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:10.670
During the Five-Anti Campaign,

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.470
he made such radical statements

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.760
that provoked some capitalists

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.830
and nearly caused a tragedy.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.190
I can see that he

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.220
hasn't learned his lesson at all.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.020
He had just transferred
from the military back then.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.230
He was not familiar

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.120
with local government work

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.740
and had no experience.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.800
He's much more experienced now.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.150
But I know

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.550
his problem is that

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.030
he's too serious

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:37.480
and gets caught up in details.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.760
But I think this kind of dedication

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:41.320
is actually good

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:43.570
and should be encouraged.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:46.510
I know

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.360
you and the chief

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.110
both think highly of him.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:50.920
Yes,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.230
the bond between those two

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.440
was forged
through life-threatening situations.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.760
Back when he had
just transferred to civilian work,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.510
I told the local comrades:

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.250
This very man,

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:03.920
this passionate young man
who had never held a gun before,

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.440
saved the chief's life
on the battlefield.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.710
The local comrades couldn't believe it.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:09.400
So,

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.710
Pu,

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.280
don't underestimate young comrade Yang.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.240
He truly has no selfish motives.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.200
He is someone

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.590
who would sacrifice

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.710
his own life
for the revolution, a good cadre.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.590
Look, even when
his mother was seriously ill,

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:27.050
he stayed at his post
and continued working.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:28.440
What could you possibly

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.590
criticize about such a good comrade?

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.760
Ms. Fang,

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:35.670
work attitude and work ability
are two different concepts.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.070
I think if you and the chief

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.870
truly want what's best for Yang,

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.110
you should send him
to factories and villages,

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.970
to train at the grassroots level.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.920
His current position of authority

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.050
will actually harm him in the long run.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.500
When you first joined
the revolutionary work,

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.150
you weren't as mature
and experienced as you are now.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:55.400
Didn't you also grow step by step?

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:56.420
Our Party's cadres

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.280
are all cultivated
through practical experience.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.490
You need to help him properly.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:04.110
This isn't coming from me.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.590
Chief Yan said so.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:08.440
Alright.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.150
Come to our home for dinner tonight.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:12.280
I can't tonight.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.880
I need to find Fu Zihe
and have a talk with him.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.880
Yang has offended him,

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:19.770
and I need to clean up the mess.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.780
Alright then, I'll be going now.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.450
I'll visit Chief Yan another day.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.280
Help him out.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:52.480
Excuse me.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:54.610
May I come in?

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.340
Did you paint
those pictures in the hallway?

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:08.920
Yes.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.710
I'm really curious.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.400
Your landscapes

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.830
have influences
from French Impressionist painters

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:21.900
like Monet.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.850
But your figure paintings,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.190
especially this one of the female worker,

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.520
also show influences from Soviet Realism

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.010
like Repin.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.920
How did you manage
to incorporate both styles?

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.730
Repin was my husband's favorite painter.

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:39.630
He introduced me to his work.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.670
I see.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.920
Your husband

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.960
was a man of taste.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.840
I'm guessing this piece,

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.150
by Rachmaninoff,

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:56.080
was also your husband's favorite?

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:00.000
Yes,

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.660
he loved Soviet Russian culture.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:04.400
That's nice.

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:07.410
By the way,

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.000
regarding your husband's case,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.920
the relevant authorities
are investigating.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.230
I believe there will be results soon.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:15.510
Thank you.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.850
I didn't realize you appreciated art.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:22.580
I apologize for my rudeness

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.110
earlier.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:26.350
It's alright.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:27.450
That's normal.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.800
Because

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:31.590
you

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.280
don't know us.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:37.230
Well.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.230
I won't disturb you anymore.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:40.230
Please continue.

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:43.110
Goodbye.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.000
Goodbye.
