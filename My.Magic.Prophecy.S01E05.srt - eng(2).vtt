00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
Would you like to have dinner at my house?

00:00:03.832 --> 00:00:06.712
He’s an athlete who got injured.

00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:07.728
Now in recovery.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.288
Mom, what’s happening to you?!

00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:10.072
Get out of the way, please.

00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:11.224
If I didn’t know he’s an athlete,

00:00:11.248 --> 00:00:12.544
I’d swear he’s a doctor.

00:00:12.576 --> 00:00:14.540
Your dream already passed.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.024
I just had another one.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.176
I don’t know if I can save you in time.

00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:20.904
If Mrs. Tara wakes up,

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:22.760
she’ll be the key witness.

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:26.256
I just hope she tells the truth if she wakes up.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.992
It’s because of your dream.

00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:29.656
My life now feels like a dream come true.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.900
How nice.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.300
Mm.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.690
How nice.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.176
You’re cute.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Hey.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.016
How nice.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:52.950
Mm.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.220
How nice.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.290
Thap.

00:00:56.184 --> 00:00:57.440
Thap.

00:01:10.472 --> 00:01:11.544
Thap.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.160
Thap!

00:01:15.192 --> 00:01:16.192
Oh.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.152
No “good morning”?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.624
Oh—right.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.992
Good morning, In.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.352
Still hungover?

00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:32.576
A little.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.728
I made rice porridge.

00:01:35.768 --> 00:01:37.216
Go sit, I’ll bring it to you.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.120
Isn’t it burning?

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.160
What?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.560
Hey!

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.600
Ouch!

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.440
Let me see.

00:02:03.472 --> 00:02:04.584
Is it stinging?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.808
No, it’s fine.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:20.944
Go sit down.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.768
I’ll bring you the porridge.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.480
Go on.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.488
You sure you’re fine?

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:27.584
Yes, I’m sure.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.592
It’s alright.

00:02:51.608 --> 00:02:52.752
I’ll do the dishes.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.848
In? In, are you home?

00:02:58.112 --> 00:02:59.432
Yes, Auntie Jan.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.424
Hello, Auntie Jan.

00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:05.144
Hi, dear.

00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:06.064
Are you free?

00:03:06.096 --> 00:03:07.944
Want to come see my avocado orchard?

00:03:07.968 --> 00:03:09.568
They’re huge this year.

00:03:09.608 --> 00:03:10.608
Come.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.456
Well, I…

00:03:13.488 --> 00:03:14.488
We’re coming!

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.070
We’re coming.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.816
Follow me, young men.

00:05:04.848 --> 00:05:06.576
Check out my avocado orchard.

00:05:06.616 --> 00:05:08.280
It’s really abundant.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.280
Wow, there are so many. Look!

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.288
Whoa.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.744
This one’s good to eat.

00:05:17.768 --> 00:05:19.144
You can just pick them if you want.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.376
Really, Auntie?

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.840
Of course.

00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:23.848
See?

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.080
It’s for me?

00:05:26.104 --> 00:05:27.152
- Yes. - Thank you.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.232
It’s like In owns this orchard too.

00:05:32.256 --> 00:05:34.768
He suggested I plant it

00:05:34.808 --> 00:05:37.280
and even helped with the funding.

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:38.632
Take as many as you want, dear.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.192
Auntie Jan, watch him.

00:05:40.208 --> 00:05:41.968
He might take them all.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.512
Go ahead.

00:05:43.536 --> 00:05:44.208
Even if you took them all,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.880
I wouldn’t say a word.

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:48.904
For In, I’d do anything.

00:05:48.944 --> 00:05:50.648
- Are you serious, Auntie? - Of course.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.416
- Thank you. - No problem.

00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:01.184
So, Auntie Jan, have you been doing well?

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.968
Not so well.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.776
It’s partly why I wanted to see you.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.168
What’s the matter, Auntie?

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.040
I think I’ve been cursed.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.000
Cursed?

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.888
That’s right.

00:06:19.936 --> 00:06:24.768
The mistress my husband ran off with must have put a curse on me.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.320
In hasn’t been so precise lately, Auntie.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.320
He’s a little sick.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.620
Let me handle the fortune-telling.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.440
Are you sure you can?

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.140
I’m ready.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.960
How do we do this?

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.952
You don’t have any cards.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.944
Or do you need my date of birth?

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.464
It’s a new way of reading, Auntie.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.030
May I?

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.784
Keep your eyes on my finger.

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:12.472
Okay.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.500
Do this.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.352
Have you had sore eyes or blurry vision lately?

00:07:28.368 --> 00:07:30.350
Yes, sometimes my eyes hurt,

00:07:30.376 --> 00:07:32.920
and things get blurry.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:33.952
Mm.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.856
Do you experience trouble sleeping,

00:07:36.888 --> 00:07:39.624
weight loss, irritability, sweating,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.984
hand shaking, or a pounding heart?

00:07:42.368 --> 00:07:44.370
Goodness gracious!

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.088
You’re absolutely precise.

00:07:46.128 --> 00:07:47.824
Mm…

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.224
Looks like you’re in a phase of misfortune.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.952
Your star might have shifted.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.888
I’m not sure if it’s a curse,

00:07:56.912 --> 00:07:59.616
but you could get hurt.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.592
An easy way to fix it is to go to a hospital.

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:05.336
That way, you won’t get hurt somewhere else.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.592
If a doctor says you’re sick,

00:08:09.624 --> 00:08:11.590
believe them you’re sick.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.752
Acknowledge your misfortune,

00:08:16.776 --> 00:08:17.928
wish for it to pass,

00:08:17.952 --> 00:08:19.600
and follow your doctor’s instructions.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.008
All right, I’ll do that.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.384
Thank you so much, young man.

00:08:25.408 --> 00:08:26.344
It’s my pleasure.

00:08:26.368 --> 00:08:28.024
No problem at all.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.984
So, how much should I pay for your service?

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.328
It can be the avocados you let me pick.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.416
Sure, sure.

00:08:38.456 --> 00:08:40.440
I’ll pack them in a box for you.

00:08:40.472 --> 00:08:42.136
Thank you, thank you.

00:08:42.168 --> 00:08:43.312
Why, thank you so much.

00:08:43.336 --> 00:08:44.336
Of course.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.864
Get well soon.

00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:46.960
You’re spot on.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.592
What’s wrong with Auntie Jan?

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.480
What did you lie to her about?

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.192
I think it’s Graves’ disease.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.020
What’s that?

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.560
It’s an autoimmune disorder of the thyroid.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.536
If she doesn’t go to a hospital soon,

00:09:06.752 --> 00:09:09.560
it could become overactive and endanger her life.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.780
Here.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.360
You said you hated fortune-telling,

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.384
but you sounded like a scam fortune teller.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.968
Mr. In,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.120
don’t forget my family was scammed by fortune tellers all their lives.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.696
Though I don’t like it,

00:09:27.736 --> 00:09:29.296
I have all the information packed away.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.300
You wanna bet whether

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.488
Auntie Jan goes to a hospital or not?

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.176
What do I get if I win?

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.790
What do you want?

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.300
Can’t think of it right now.

00:09:52.904 --> 00:09:53.920
I’ll tell you once I win.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:08.944
See? I told you

00:10:08.968 --> 00:10:10.456
Auntie Jan would go to the hospital.

00:10:10.504 --> 00:10:12.400
Because you tricked her into going.

00:10:12.424 --> 00:10:13.768
Hey, I didn’t trick her.

00:10:13.816 --> 00:10:15.770
I just cooperated well, okay?

00:10:15.808 --> 00:10:17.992
You told me not to argue with the villagers.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.672
Yeah, you’re such a cooperator.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.408
Remember, you still owe me a prize.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.784
Stop. Park here.

00:10:24.808 --> 00:10:25.160
Hm?

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200
Stop here.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.290
What?

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.560
Tul!

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.490
In!

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.552
Wow, you’ve been gone.

00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:52.712
How are you doing?

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.472
I’m doing okay.

00:10:54.504 --> 00:10:55.824
Glad to hear that.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.310
Oh.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.360
Thap, hello.

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:00.392
Hello.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.592
How come you’re here with In?

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.784
No. It’s you. What brings you here?

00:11:07.592 --> 00:11:09.360
Chiang Mai is my hometown.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.080
I can’t stop by to visit?

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.424
Your home is in Chiang Mai.

00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:15.112
Mae Hong Son’s quite a far stop for you.

00:11:17.216 --> 00:11:20.040
So, what are you doing here, Thap?

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.656
I guess you didn’t stop by either, right?

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.552
No, I wasn’t passing by.

00:11:25.568 --> 00:11:26.568
I came with In.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.800
You came with In?

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.024
Well, it’s…

00:11:32.056 --> 00:11:33.168
I’m In’s boyfriend.

00:11:37.568 --> 00:11:38.736
Come here, Thap.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.264
In, slow down! In!

00:11:40.288 --> 00:11:41.320
I’m holding the avocados.

00:11:41.352 --> 00:11:42.352
Thap!

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.880
Why did you lie to Tul?

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:45.744
I didn’t lie.

00:11:45.768 --> 00:11:47.280
I was planning to hit on you anyway.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.680
I didn’t want to rush it at first,

00:11:49.712 --> 00:11:51.552
but look—my rival is here.

00:11:51.584 --> 00:11:52.904
I have to make a move now, right?

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.872
Don’t joke about this.

00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:56.870
I’m not joking. I’m serious.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.870
And I know you don’t like Tul like that.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.408
How do you know?

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.192
Come on. I can see it in your eyes.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.512
Dao also told me.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.912
Dao did?

00:12:08.952 --> 00:12:09.952
Um-hum.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.200
I won the bet, so I can ask for one thing, right?

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.256
I’m making my request now.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.540
And what’s that?

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.220
You have to work with me here.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.140
Just like that?

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.584
In, listen.

00:12:27.616 --> 00:12:31.432
Having a secret crush on someone is torture.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.384
So if you don’t like them,

00:12:34.408 --> 00:12:35.968
help them get over you.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.064
Don’t lead them on.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.808
Look. He’s coming.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.704
Hey. Listen to me.

00:12:51.912 --> 00:12:53.352
There’s one thing I’m worried about.

00:12:54.736 --> 00:12:57.152
He might ask to spend the night here.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.104
If he does, I’m sleeping in your room tonight.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.208
What? No!

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.552
No way!

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.104
Then don’t let him stay overnight.

00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:08.112
Okay?

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.616
Why are you this kind of person?

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.360
I’m a doctor, In. So, I’m pretty smart.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:18.888
Go on.

00:13:18.912 --> 00:13:19.960
Deal with him.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.590
What scheme were you two cooking up?

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.336
Scheme, my ass.

00:13:33.368 --> 00:13:34.456
We didn’t cook anything.

00:13:34.488 --> 00:13:36.976
I’m telling you, I don’t buy it.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.240
Okay.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.184
If you don’t buy it, come together.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.660
Where?

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.128
To teach the children.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.680
What? Teach the children?

00:13:49.696 --> 00:13:50.760
Let’s go.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.912
I’m a doctor. I want to teach the children.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.390
Come on.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.200
Okay then.

00:13:56.232 --> 00:14:00.160
Should we go now so we can finish early?

00:14:00.208 --> 00:14:02.008
Driving at night is dangerous.

00:14:02.024 --> 00:14:03.656
Good. Excellent idea.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:04.950
Hey…

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.768
You’re not planning on letting me

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.432
spend the night at all, are you?

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.256
Today, the police called in Mr. Kasidis Rakvanit, a former famous actor,

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.376
to question him in the murder case of Mrs. Tara’s parents,

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.736
after she, a major stakeholder of Rakbumrung Hospital,

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.376
fell unconscious under suspicious circumstances.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.616
I understand, Inspector,

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:34.184
that you must question those close to her, especially her husband.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.576
But I would never do anything to hurt Tara.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.784
I love my wife deeply.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.872
Without her, I wouldn’t know how to live.

00:14:53.904 --> 00:14:55.900
Before Mrs. Tara fell ill,

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.944
did you two have any arguments?

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.160
No.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.040
We never fight.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:11.080
Mr. Kasidis, how much do you know about Mrs. Tara’s illness?

00:15:15.568 --> 00:15:17.368
I know she has a heart condition.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.544
As for the details,

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.390
she discusses them directly with her doctor.

00:15:23.352 --> 00:15:25.350
She’s the hospital’s stakeholder.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.752
The staff should be more aware than I am.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.224
But you were the one who picked up her last prescription.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.968
Surely you must know something.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.744
I just wanted to lighten my wife’s burden.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.944
Does that include the Health Center project in Bang Kachao as well?

00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:58.390
His acting was damn good.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.384
I remember when he was an actor,

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.400
he wasn’t this smooth.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.432
Can’t you issue an arrest warrant now?

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.088
If we do it now, he’ll slip through the cracks.

00:16:10.112 --> 00:16:11.392
Then he’ll definitely disappear.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.576
If Mrs. Tara stays unconscious,

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.716
this asshole will become the hospital’s major stakeholder instead, right?

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.740
Mhm.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.608
That’s f♪cked up, Karn.

00:16:22.632 --> 00:16:23.944
You have to seize it first.

00:16:25.264 --> 00:16:28.488
No. We’d better let Thap handle it.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.032
Where is he anyway? He’s been so quiet.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.096
In Singapore.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.540
Did you forget?

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.640
You’re right.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.000
I guess I’ve been working too hard lately.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.150
I’m gonna get coffee.

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:57.848
Alright, children.

00:16:57.904 --> 00:17:03.680
Today we have three generous volunteer teachers to help us.

00:17:03.704 --> 00:17:05.248
Take a look.

00:17:05.272 --> 00:17:06.512
Are they handsome?

00:17:06.536 --> 00:17:07.688
Yes!

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.464
Yeah!

00:17:09.488 --> 00:17:11.456
Alrighty.

00:17:11.504 --> 00:17:13.752
Now, let’s see

00:17:13.792 --> 00:17:18.600
who you want as your first teacher.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.288
Teacher In,

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.592
Teacher Tul,

00:17:21.616 --> 00:17:23.288
or Teacher Thap.

00:17:23.304 --> 00:17:24.056
Who should go first?

00:17:24.088 --> 00:17:26.264
- Teacher In! - Teacher Thap!

00:17:26.288 --> 00:17:28.592
- Teacher Thap! - Teacher In!

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.992
Wait, wait, wait!

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:32.480
I can’t catch that.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.192
Let’s go one by one.

00:17:33.208 --> 00:17:35.400
Which one do you want first?

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.680
Teacher Thap.

00:17:37.736 --> 00:17:38.896
Teacher Thap?

00:17:38.944 --> 00:17:39.952
Alright.

00:17:39.984 --> 00:17:42.176
Yeah!

00:17:42.216 --> 00:17:45.992
So our first volunteer teacher is…

00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:47.272
Teacher Thap!

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.360
Take your time teaching, okay?

00:17:54.408 --> 00:17:56.848
I’m going to talk to In—just the two of us.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.300
Let’s go, In.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.180
Hey!

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.968
Come on, Teacher Thap.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.792
Alright, take your seat!

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.552
Now I know why Dao didn’t want me to come here.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.512
Seriously, why did you keep this from me?

00:18:19.968 --> 00:18:21.970
And when did you two meet each other?

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.280
You didn’t even know him at graduation.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.336
We met there.

00:18:26.384 --> 00:18:29.536
But I didn’t know he was Dao’s big brother.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.032
Then we met again at his house.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.656
You went ot his house already?

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.328
Hey, it’s Dao’s house too.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.016
Ah, right.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.020
You guys started dating after meeting only twice?

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.560
We met several times at the hospital.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.016
It’s complicated. I didn’t know how to tell you.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.400
It’s pretty strange.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.376
I’ve been here forever,

00:19:04.408 --> 00:19:05.656
yet never been the one.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.568
Kids, calm down.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.600
Relax.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.672
What’s wrong, Khaohom?

00:19:27.696 --> 00:19:29.944
It’s what Teacher Thap just taught us.

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:34.048
He said we’d be eaten by viruses. It’s scary!

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:36.980
Thap!

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.784
How could you say that to children?

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.968
That’s all good, In.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:53.376
In.

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:54.016
In!

00:19:54.032 --> 00:19:54.632
In, what’s wrong?

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:55.304
In.

00:19:55.336 --> 00:19:56.064
In, what’s the matter?

00:19:56.072 --> 00:19:56.688
In.

00:19:56.832 --> 00:19:57.832
In.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.992
Take a deep breath. Deep breath.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.240
Are you seeing visions again?

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.992
No. I guess I ran here too fast.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.840
Have some candy.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.480
Look at you, Thap.

00:20:20.528 --> 00:20:22.736
You look more like a doctor than an athlete.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:25.880
That’s because he’s a…

00:20:25.904 --> 00:20:26.904
Oh!

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.144
Should we do a doctor-patient roleplay?

00:20:32.192 --> 00:20:33.656
Yes.

00:20:33.696 --> 00:20:35.248
He’s not Teacher Thap now,

00:20:35.288 --> 00:20:39.264
but Dr. Thapfah, a friendly doctor.

00:20:39.288 --> 00:20:40.760
Does that sound good, kiddos?

00:20:40.808 --> 00:20:42.560
It does!

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.776
Hi guys. I’m Dr. Thapfah.

00:20:55.808 --> 00:20:59.128
Today I’m going to teach you all how to do CPR.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.944
Does anyone here know what CPR is?

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.144
No.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.424
You don’t? That’s fine.

00:21:07.448 --> 00:21:09.420
Today I’ll introduce it to you.

00:21:09.448 --> 00:21:12.064
CPR is basically chest compressions.

00:21:12.088 --> 00:21:14.160
Today, you’ll all learn how to do chest compressions.

00:21:14.184 --> 00:21:16.896
First, close your notebooks.

00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:20.208
Close them. Good.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.210
And then, stand up.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.712
Now that everyone is up, follow my steps.

00:21:25.736 --> 00:21:26.736
This.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.160
And This.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.608
Lace your fingers like this. Okay?

00:21:32.112 --> 00:21:34.384
Keep your arms straight.

00:21:34.408 --> 00:21:36.776
Place them on top of your notebook.

00:21:36.832 --> 00:21:41.040
Happy birthday to you…

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:09.740
Hey.

00:22:11.976 --> 00:22:13.168
Thanks.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.344
How’s Mrs. Tara?

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.952
Nothing’s changed.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.000
But at least it’s better than getting worse.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.264
Hey, how’s Thap doing?

00:22:28.296 --> 00:22:29.856
Have you been in touch with him at all?

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.784
I’m really sorry, I can’t tell you where he is.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:40.910
Mm.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.784
That’s okay. I understand.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.464
I’m just worried about him.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.720
You haven’t changed a bit.

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:52.336
What?

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.504
You’re a worrier, just like always.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.380
Let’s grab something to eat.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.864
No.

00:23:11.888 --> 00:23:13.056
You go ahead.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:20.232
Eat first.

00:23:20.248 --> 00:23:21.680
You can come back to read afterward.

00:23:21.704 --> 00:23:23.700
No. I’m worried I might fall behind.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.032
Give it back.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:28.824
Give it.

00:23:28.848 --> 00:23:29.848
Hand it over.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.500
Give it to me!

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.800
- Ton! - Eat first.

00:23:33.848 --> 00:23:35.512
Give it up. I need to study for the exams.

00:23:35.536 --> 00:23:37.040
Nutrients are important.

00:23:37.064 --> 00:23:38.872
Then you eat.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:39.992
Eat with me first.

00:23:40.024 --> 00:23:41.150
No. Ton!

00:23:41.184 --> 00:23:42.088
Food isn’t as good when you eat alone.

00:23:42.128 --> 00:23:43.280
Come on. Follow me.

00:23:44.248 --> 00:23:46.250
And you’re shy, as always.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:51.690
Just drink the damn coffee.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.872
I’ve been meaning to ask you.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.300
Ask what?

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.700
Are you dating anyone?

00:24:06.664 --> 00:24:08.056
As if I have time for that.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:11.870
Good.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.560
Stop it.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.808
You’re not really going to make me drive home right now, are you?

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.990
Right?

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:43.190
I…

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.784
I’ll go prepare Tul’s room, then.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.440
I’m curious...

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.784
Why are you hiding the fact that he’s a doctor?

00:25:00.672 --> 00:25:02.670
Can you call Dao and ask?

00:25:02.696 --> 00:25:03.824
I can’t say.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.700
Please.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.864
Dao didn’t even tell me you’re here with her brother.

00:25:08.888 --> 00:25:10.688
Do you think she’d spill anything about this?

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.248
Seriously…

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.352
What’s the big secret?

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:24.480
And you expect me to believe you and he are dating?

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.432
Wait…

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.320
As the owner of a northern food restaurant that’s been in my family for generations

00:26:10.336 --> 00:26:12.192
and as In’s close friend for a long time,

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.392
I’m sure I know him best.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:18.464
I’m In’s boyfriend.

00:26:18.496 --> 00:26:19.720
Why do I have to compete?

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:22.984
You’re already competing.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:37.176
As the house owner, I’ve decided

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.184
you two have to finish the food you cooked.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:42.632
Take responsibility.

00:26:43.008 --> 00:26:45.408
Food isn’t something to waste.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.440
Eat.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.880
Holy shit.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.848
Hey, eat this.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.888
My family recipe.

00:27:03.936 --> 00:27:04.936
I know you like it.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.600
This too.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.968
It’s good.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.464
You’ve been saying you wanted to eat it,

00:27:14.488 --> 00:27:15.808
so eat a lot.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.432
Eat only as much as you want.

00:27:18.464 --> 00:27:20.272
Have what you can handle,

00:27:20.312 --> 00:27:21.568
and I’ll take care of the rest.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.180
Mhm.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.952
I need to consume more protein.

00:27:44.984 --> 00:27:45.984
Doctor’s orders.

00:27:47.288 --> 00:27:48.400
Which doctor?

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.208
Would you like some digestive aid?

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:03.710
Do you have some?

00:28:04.688 --> 00:28:05.688
Yes, please.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:09.850
Thank you.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.544
I’ve got a question.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.280
How did you know In?

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:21.216
I met In at his graduation event.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:23.820
When?

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.840
When I went to use the bathroom

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.560
before we entered the hall.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.632
You mean the time you disappeared for so long?

00:28:30.656 --> 00:28:31.656
Mm.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.176
In fainted.

00:28:34.216 --> 00:28:35.216
I caught him just in time,

00:28:35.224 --> 00:28:36.448
so we had a chance to talk.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.620
That’s it?

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:42.872
I liked him right away.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.110
Ridiculous.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.480
The next time we met, you almost chewed me out.

00:28:48.512 --> 00:28:49.096
Hey.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.952
That’s because, Mr. Fortune Teller,

00:28:50.976 --> 00:28:53.272
you said I was gonna die in front of my mom.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.728
But it was true, wasn’t it?

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:57.330
Yeah, it was.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.696
I liked you anyway.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.152
And when we met again,

00:29:01.176 --> 00:29:02.176
I liked you even more,

00:29:02.224 --> 00:29:04.220
especially when you came to rescue me.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.790
Don’t forget the time you were being foul-mouthed at me.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.080
Foul-mouthed?

00:29:08.256 --> 00:29:09.256
Mm.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.064
Ah!

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.448
You mean when you crashed your bike?

00:29:14.496 --> 00:29:15.280
Mm.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.448
It’s not just your bike that can’t stay up,

00:29:17.488 --> 00:29:18.872
you’ve gone down a few times too.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.776
If I hadn’t been there,

00:29:20.824 --> 00:29:23.384
you’d have a concussion by now.

00:29:23.408 --> 00:29:24.408
Right?

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.700
Why did you come to help then?

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.896
Because I like you. You smell good.

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:29.272
Thap!

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.656
Don’t hit me. I just finished eating.

00:29:31.688 --> 00:29:32.856
I didn’t hit your stomach.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.088
What about our promise?

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.960
What promise?

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:44.056
In and I promised that if we’re both single by the time we turn 30, we’d get together.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.904
Why did you make him that promise if you didn’t even like him?

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:55.760
Please.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.880
It wasn’t exactly a promise.

00:29:57.928 --> 00:29:59.448
I was just tired of arguing with him.

00:29:59.496 --> 00:30:03.184
And seriously, 30 isn’t even that old.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.820
Hold on.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.912
Are you upset about the promise or the age?

00:30:06.936 --> 00:30:07.976
Don’t change the subject.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:12.464
What if he gets serious when you turn 30?

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.480
Hm?

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.140
Well…

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.020
Getting together with a friend should feel pretty good, right?

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.776
Friends and lovers aren’t the same, In.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:27.464
How?

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.460
Gosh.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.240
Has your heart ever raced with Tul?

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.424
If Tul holds your hand like this,

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:56.960
does your heart skip?

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.304
If Tul gets close like this,

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.900
does your heart pound?

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:23.928
When we like someone, just seeing them walk in lights up the whole room.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.992
Just like when you walk into the kitchen in the morning.

00:31:36.536 --> 00:31:38.540
When you said you liked me at first sight,

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.900
was that true?

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:45.770
It was.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:48.630
That’s funny.

00:31:48.784 --> 00:31:50.500
Hey, it’s not.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:51.952
I really like you.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.406
If it weren’t for all the messy stuff that happened,

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.390
I would’ve found an excuse to hit on you long ago.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:59.312
Are you seducing me?

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.152
Yeah. I’m hitting on you and seducing you.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:04.510
Is that okay?

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.072
You’re annoying.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.088
But you do smell good. It wasn’t a joke.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.040
I didn’t come to right away

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.360
because you smell good, too.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.464
Come smell me then.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.048
Thap!

00:32:29.088 --> 00:32:30.224
What are you doing?

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:31.144
Geez.

00:32:31.176 --> 00:32:32.300
What the heck?

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:38.128
Get some sleep already, Doc.

00:32:45.592 --> 00:32:46.592
In.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.328
What now?

00:32:50.816 --> 00:32:52.304
Right now, your heart is…

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.224
beating so loud.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.240
Gosh! Doc, I said go to sleep.

00:32:56.288 --> 00:32:57.848
Get some sleep.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.392
Good night.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.528
I heard you.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:09.184
Just sleep.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.672
Now!

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.328
Thap, what are you doing?

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:21.832
You snuggled up so much last night, I nearly tumbled out of bed.

00:34:22.128 --> 00:34:23.216
Yet, I didn’t complain.

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:26.144
Stop it, Thap. What is this?

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:30.888
Keep it down, or your friend will hear.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.744
Let him hear us.

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:36.264
Thap, what are you doing?!

00:34:36.288 --> 00:34:37.928
- Thap! - Shhh.

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.180
Ouch.

00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:42.520
Did you just bite me?

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:45.370
You’re gonna get this!

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.000
Whoa, you woke up so early.

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:16.728
Couldn’t sleep.

00:35:16.776 --> 00:35:18.056
Guess I’m not used to the place.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:19.730
Yeah?

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.880
Thap.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.328
You want some avocado?

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:31.680
Yes, please.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:37.720
Here.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.080
Thank you.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:46.960
In, is that the jam we bought?

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.096
Yes, it’s good.

00:35:49.128 --> 00:35:51.144
Really? Can I try a bit?

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.984
Wow, it’s good.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.784
Eating it with avocado must be amazing.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:00.140
Want to try some?

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.720
After breakfast,

00:36:04.752 --> 00:36:05.992
I need to have a word with you.

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:10.520
What exactly do you want from In?

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.352
Nothing. I just want In.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.048
If that’s all it takes,

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.496
I can be his boyfriend too.

00:36:18.336 --> 00:36:19.464
No, you can’t.

00:36:19.496 --> 00:36:21.944
In has feelings for me, not you.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.704
Don’t you think you’re a little full of yourself?

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.552
What do you know about In?

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.576
Do you know he doesn’t like people touching him?

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.664
He doesn’t?

00:36:37.696 --> 00:36:39.536
I have physical contact with him all the time.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.056
Has he ever dreamed about you?

00:36:47.096 --> 00:36:48.296
He dreamed about me, you know.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.992
If you’re truly close to him, you know what that means.

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.144
It means you’re about to die.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.080
It means I’m someone important to In.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.824
Well, I’ll wait for him anyway.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.784
I have no problem with that.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.240
But tell me this.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.600
Don’t you feel bad for In at all?

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.700
Why?

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:17.752
He cares so much about you,

00:37:18.856 --> 00:37:20.896
but he has to turn you down over and over.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.120
Have you ever thought about how hard that is for him?

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.510
In!

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.900
In!

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.352
In! In!

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.264
In, are you alright?

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:43.176
He’s my guy. I’ll take care of him.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.780
In.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.920
In.

00:37:56.688 --> 00:37:57.688
Thap.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:01.430
Thap.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.620
Thap.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.544
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.208
Are you hurt?

00:38:07.232 --> 00:38:08.232
Thap.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.488
Don’t go anywhere.

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:18.110
Thap.

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:35.632
Hello, Mrs. Tara.

00:38:35.664 --> 00:38:37.152
How are you feeling today?

00:38:37.504 --> 00:38:39.500
May I check for a bit?

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.200
Call Dr. Pokpong.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.600
Tell him to come here immediately.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.900
Yes, Doctor.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.096
Drive home safe.

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:00.888
Is he really taking good care of you?

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:05.830
Yes.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.136
The best care.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.448
Please take care of him.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:13.752
Of course.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:15.944
I’ll take extra good care of him.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:22.570
I’m hitting the road.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.720
I’ll see you later.

00:39:23.736 --> 00:39:24.736
See you.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.080
You fainted.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.128
Did you see something again?

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:15.056
This time, it was clear and felt so real

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.144
Don’t like me, Thap.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.424
I don’t want to have anyone

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.256
only to lose them again.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.300
In.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.128
If I told you…

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.576
I’d be okay, would you believe me?

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.272
Even if you’re fine,

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.432
would we even make it?

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:32.000
Our beliefs are the opposite.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:39.384
You don’t even like my profession.

00:41:42.736 --> 00:41:44.740
And if I loved you

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.736
and we had to break up,

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.216
what would I do?

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:29.720
What are you doing?

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.168
Pick a card.

00:42:47.968 --> 00:42:48.968
No.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.336
Pick a card, In.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:56.250
No.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.040
Pick one card, please.

00:44:11.416 --> 00:44:12.416
Meaning?

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.192
Hope and healing.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.040
Is it good?

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:28.256
Do you believe it?

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:53.848
I don’t believe the card.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.872
I believe you.

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.280
Let’s give you a sponge bath

00:46:32.312 --> 00:46:33.330
to bring your fever down.

00:46:34.056 --> 00:46:35.056
Mm.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:26.528
Tul told me

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.360
you don’t like people touching you.

00:48:34.488 --> 00:48:36.490
I’m afraid I’ll see their future.

00:48:38.608 --> 00:48:40.408
Then how did you manage when you had partners?

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:50.360
No partners.

00:48:54.112 --> 00:48:56.016
Every time I was about to start dating someone,

00:48:58.070 --> 00:48:59.520
no matter how hard I tried,

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.520
I just couldn’t get past it.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:37.584
You standing there Makes my heart feel light

00:49:37.624 --> 00:49:44.352
Not too close, yet not too far from sight

00:49:44.384 --> 00:49:51.144
All I want is to know the path we take

00:49:51.176 --> 00:49:58.120
Will hold you close With every step we make

00:49:58.152 --> 00:50:05.080
If fate meant for us To share only half the journey

00:50:05.128 --> 00:50:10.728
Then until everything changes its scenery

00:50:10.752 --> 00:50:11.752
Thap.

00:50:32.264 --> 00:50:34.260
Whatever you see from here on,

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.720
please hang in there.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.608
I promise

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:45.544
I won’t ever leave you.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:14.320
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

00:51:14.368 --> 00:51:21.192
Don’t give up your life for me, That’s never my creed

00:51:21.224 --> 00:51:29.032
Having you close Is beyond a dream come true

00:51:29.048 --> 00:51:32.560
No matter how far we drift apart

00:51:32.592 --> 00:51:36.248
We’ll always find a way to restart

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:41.960
Because in this world, There’s only one you

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:56.672
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

00:51:56.696 --> 00:52:03.328
Don’t give up your life for me, That’s never my creed

00:52:03.368 --> 00:52:11.320
Having you close Is beyond a dream come true

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.752
No matter how far we drift apart

00:52:14.792 --> 00:52:18.504
We’ll always find a way to restart

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:23.952
Because in this world, There’s only one you

00:52:23.976 --> 00:52:30.872
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:37.800
Don’t give up your life for me, That’s never my creed

00:52:37.824 --> 00:52:45.656
Having you close Is beyond a dream come true

00:52:45.696 --> 00:52:48.936
No matter how far we drift apart

00:52:48.976 --> 00:52:52.744
We’ll always find a way to restart

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:58.176
Because in this world, There’s only one you

00:52:58.216 --> 00:53:05.200
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

00:53:05.232 --> 00:53:13.032
Being by my side each day is all I need

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:19.088
Now I know why

00:53:19.128 --> 00:53:20.944
Dao didn’t want me to come here.

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:24.728
Seriously, why did you keep this from me?

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.912
Khaohom, do you want Teacher In to help teach with me?

00:53:33.952 --> 00:53:38.528
Yes. I prefer Teacher In here with Teacher Thap.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.312
You’re the best.

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:41.888
Then you have to help me.

00:53:41.904 --> 00:53:42.904
Come here.

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:01.536
Ready, everyone?

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.472
Yes!

00:54:03.504 --> 00:54:04.648
Alright, excellent.

00:54:04.688 --> 00:54:06.952
Hello, I’m Teacher Thap.

00:54:06.992 --> 00:54:09.432
Today, I’m going to teach you about viruses.

00:54:09.464 --> 00:54:11.616
Has anyone here ever caught a cold?

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.544
Ah, everyone has.

00:54:14.568 --> 00:54:18.864
That happens because viruses attack us.

00:54:18.912 --> 00:54:19.888
Viruses?

00:54:19.936 --> 00:54:21.472
Oh, my God!

00:54:21.488 --> 00:54:22.864
Oh, my God!

00:54:22.896 --> 00:54:24.344
Viruses attack us.

00:54:24.376 --> 00:54:28.320
And if you don’t take care of your health,

00:54:28.352 --> 00:54:30.792
they’ll come and… eat you!

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:32.968
Argh!

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:50.712
What’s wrong, Khaohom?

00:54:50.736 --> 00:54:52.984
It’s what Teacher Thap just taught us.

00:54:53.008 --> 00:54:57.032
He said we’d be eaten by viruses. It’s scary!

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:00.030
Thap!

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:03.944
How could you say that to children?

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.808
Why do you want a reading all of a sudden?

00:55:29.848 --> 00:55:32.560
I want to know if I’ve found my soulmate yet.

00:55:32.592 --> 00:55:34.408
Your car window has been smashed, sir.

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.136
Someone’s threatening me to stop working on my case.

00:55:38.176 --> 00:55:40.552
So, will you two still be here

00:55:40.592 --> 00:55:42.352
to join the New Year’s party?

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:46.632
If we’re leaving for Bangkok soon,

00:55:46.672 --> 00:55:50.536
until then, can we stay in the same room?

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:51.780
Are you sure?

00:55:52.208 --> 00:55:54.210
I know it won’t be easy.

00:55:54.232 --> 00:55:55.848
But I trust you.
