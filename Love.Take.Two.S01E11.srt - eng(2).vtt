00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.710
It's a relief.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.140
But I feel...

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.770
It's so great, but...

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.620
I guess I still can't believe it.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.880
It's scary.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.590
It's a relief,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.870
but it makes you worry, and you're scared, too.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.620
It's natural to feel that way.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.020
But look.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.120
Hyo Ri has such a dependable mom,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.750
and there's Chef Kim, who's always on her side.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.800
And she has her friends.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.110
She'll hang in there.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.670
Yes.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.240
Right.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.800
And you have me.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.140
I think it's your turn to lean on me, Ji An.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.050
I'll be by your side.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.860
Let's make sure to protect Hyo Ri.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.830
You just need to keep doing
what you've been doing.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.980
You've been doing a good job
without the need to do more.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.360
So, I know it's hard to hear this,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.080
but there are some things
you should know before the surgery.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.960
You'll hear it with Hyo Ri
once you get to the hospital.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.450
I thought it'd be better if you knew in advance.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.890
In Hyo Ri's case, she'll be having awake surgery.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.720
So, the surgery process might be harder for her.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.190
Nerve damage, seizures,

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.590
increased brain pressure, or cerebral edema.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.070
Be aware that dangerous things
like those could occur.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.420
The location of the tumor

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.360
is near the part that's
in charge of language function.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.520
After the surgery,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.900
she might end up having language
disability as a side effect.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.600
[Episode 11. To you, who resembles me]

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.930
When she's hospitalized next Tuesday

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.330
and gets surgery on Friday,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.920
I'll be away from the shop for two or three weeks.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.050
It's a major surgery.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.650
Yes.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.360
But she'll recover quickly
since she's young, right?

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.410
- Yes.
- I should feed you guys health food before you go.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.660
I have tons of healthy ingredients.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.220
I'll feed Hyo Ri and you, too.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.100
Seon Yeong.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.000
What?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.710
You know Hyo Ri and I feel
so supported by you, right?

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.790
Let's hang in there for her.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.000
Of course. Hey, our menopause can be powerful.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.950
We laugh and cry easily.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.290
Let's keep her confused next to her.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.390
We'll be sad, happy, sad, and happy.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.200
Then, she'll be like, "I shouldn't be like them."
And get better quickly.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.680
You're right.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.460
Okay. Let's do that.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.780
Don't worry so much.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.070
I'll make you chicken soup.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.610
Is he not here?

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.850
Huh? What's up?

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.380
Are you here to see Bo Hyeon?

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.870
I'm here to see you.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.710
Me?

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.880
Would you like to go on a date
after you're off work?

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.570
It's a bit early to eat, isn't it?

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.390
It is. It's an awkward time.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.890
[Arcade]

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.750
Should we hang out there and eat later?

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.110
Huh?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.300
You really know how to play this?
This is a very old game.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.700
While my friends studied English
and Math, I studied this game.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.540
Whenever my mom was stressed at work,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.220
she brought me to the arcade to play this.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.990
This is my forte.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.420
Don't be upset after you lose.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.780
You choose a character first.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.000
Then, I'll choose Iori.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.280
Iori.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.020
Nice.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.020
Wow...

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.990
Ready, go.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.280
Geez. Hey!

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.700
And throw a punch at once and...

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.860
K.O.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.510
Gosh.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.420
K.O.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.380
Should we go?

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.740
I can't leave like this.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.200
Let's play another game.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.880
I'll be Iori this time.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.700
The bad gamers always want
to switch characters after losing.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.450
You're just like your mom.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.540
You talk to yourself for others to hear.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.810
I learned that, too.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.170
Let's go.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.840
The buttons aren't working. The buttons...

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.680
Okay!

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.870
K.O.!

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.470
- Jump, jump, jump!
- Okay, okay!

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.050
- I got it! I got it!
- Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.470
Okay!

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.630
K.O.!

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.850
Go away.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.400
You think this is fun? Go.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.800
Should we stop?

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.680
I don't really feel like playing this.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.630
Okay.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.380
Are you angry?

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.270
Hyo Ri, I get very competitive
whenever I do something.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.850
I sometimes lose my cool.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.240
I guess you don't get frozen
shoulders and whatnot.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.370
Your hands were as quick as most kids.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.550
Let's go eat since that was the plan.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.030
Okay, let's.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.990
What do you like? I'll get you anything you like.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I know it was a game, but I got so
beat up that I have no appetite.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.150
Should we go there?

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.630
Huh?

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.140
Let's eat something tasty.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.050
I said I'll treat you properly today.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.330
I've never been to a tented snack bar.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.620
I've always wanted to. Let's go.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.260
Let's go. Let's go.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.530
Ahjussi, can I eat a lot?

00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.920
Listen to you.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.310
Go ahead and fill up the table.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.890
If so, I'll...

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.140
order pork rind and chicken gizzards.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.380
Yeah? Then, I'll...

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.250
get chicken feet and spicy sea snails.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.000
Sounds good. Let's eat a lot and order more.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.670
I have a generous heart,
but a generous stomach, too.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.500
Trust me.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.080
- Over here!
- Over here!

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.130
Wow. You're a good eater.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.850
Good girl.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.430
What do you like the most?

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.050
The pork rind.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.510
I've never had this before.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.420
It's totally my thing.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.600
I would've tried it sooner if I had known.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.000
I know a really good pork rind spot nearby.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.800
- Let's go there sometime.
- I'd love to.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.500
But because of the surgery next week,
it's hard to plan it now.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.780
Anyway, promise to take me there sometime.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.160
I-Is the surgery happening sooner?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.650
Well, yes.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.730
I got a call today that it'll happen next week.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:59.500
Ahjussi, Mom is very clumsy around you, isn't she?

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.420
I guess, a little?

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.350
It's because she's never been in a relationship.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.580
She adopted me when she was 23.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.850
She skipped over to be a mom even
before she had a chance to date.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:21.150
But thanks to you, she looks so happy these days.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:27.910
Being inexperienced can be good at our age.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:31.480
She's cute and very playful.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.430
To summarize her life in a word,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.310
it'd be "fighting."

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.960
She might look dogged,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.400
but she's straightforward, soft-hearted,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.710
and she can't be calculative.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:00.900
She has just endured things
with child-like sincerity.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.280
That means she's a good person.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.770
So, when I think of Mom,

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.050
it aches right here.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.010
That means she feels for her.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:19.980
But when I think of Mom, it also feels...

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.540
like springtime in here.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.900
I hope you feel that way, too.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.030
She wants me to take good care of her mom.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.930
I like her a lot.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.330
I won't make her feel lonely.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.950
Get me grilled eel.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.060
Okay. Let's.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.200
Excuse me.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.840
Eat a lot.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.950
This is good.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.380
So good.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.910
- Ji An.
- Yes.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.300
Over there.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.740
Oppa.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.570
Did you wait long?

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.950
We finished a bit late today.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.650
I was just with Hyo Ri.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.320
I won't cry.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.680
You don't have to cry. But it's okay if you do.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.300
Say anything you want.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.870
And you don't have to say anything.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.410
Just do whatever you want to do.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.340
You can do that with me.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.470
I swear I won't cry.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.340
You woke up when I was sleeping.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.510
I don't know why we're doing this so early.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.730
The doctor told you to work out.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.510
Walking barefoot like this
makes me feel energized.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.150
Doesn't it already make you feel healthy?

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.830
You know how to influence people.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.350
Dr. Jung.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.200
I feel so reassured having you
by Hyo Ri and Ji An's side.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:13.140
So, I won't worry about Hyo Ri and feel anxious.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.630
I just hope it goes the way it should.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.330
When does Tae Oh come back to work?

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.160
I told him to enjoy his time with his mom fully.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.480
Good job.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.680
You're so generous, Chef Kim.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.750
Did you just compliment me, Dr. Jung?

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.770
Seeing that side of you when I had no expectation

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.010
moves me a lot more.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.270
You aren't just generous.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.130
You're very thoughtful.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.170
I'm not that great.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.710
It'd be nice if you were
a little better at reading the air.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:07.870
When I was in school, kids said
I had an eye on the back of my head.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.600
Because I was so quick, they said
I had an eye on the back of my head.

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:14.710
That's what they used to say. You know?

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.210
Really?

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.310
Let's just say it's true.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.770
She offends subtly.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.940
It's strangely offensive.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.230
But I lose if I get offended now.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.620
I'm not offended.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.030
I don't get affected so easily.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.270
- You came.
- Hey.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.180
Let's lend our hands at Hyo Ri's shop.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.120
We can each pick a day.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.130
And don't ask Hyo Ri detailed
questions about the surgery.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.900
I'll do research. Ask me instead.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.540
She must be anxious already.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.260
How about you? Won't you do anything?

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.960
I'll take care of her mental state.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.400
I'll tell her not to cry and get her act together.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.350
Did you do military training secretly?
She's like a military senior.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.150
Leave her alone, you bastard.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.910
- What did I do?
- Shit.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.960
It breaks my heart.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:36.100
She's tough, but she's delicate.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.730
She may sound tough, but she gets easily scared.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.460
She's fragile. What do we do?

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.340
She probably can't show her struggles.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:53.190
That makes me even sadder.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.570
It's okay.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.780
She'll be okay.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.500
So, cry all you want here,
and don't cry in front of her.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:14.000
Why does he look so skinny already?

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.760
[Operation prep / Order of operation]

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.240
[Post-op]

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.830
Bo Hyeon.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.850
I'll be driving Hyo Ri to the hospital tomorrow.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.900
Have you seen her?

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.270
We'll meet briefly later.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.400
How do you feel?

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.560
Complicated.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.530
I'm thinking about what I can do.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.100
You share the same worry as I do.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.490
I've heard sincerity is powerful.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.280
Let's ask ourselves how we really feel.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.050
When will it stop raining?

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.180
It'll stop soon.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.960
We aren't open yet.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.280
Huh? Tae Oh.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.330
I know.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.010
You missed me a lot since I've been gone, right?

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.470
You're right.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:34.280
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.710
Gosh, the crown daisy will flower soon.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.860
Seon Yeong.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.660
Gosh. Why are you back so early, Tae Oh?

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.920
I told you to rest more.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.490
You look happy because you've
spent time with your mom.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.900
What? What?

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.510
Huh?

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.680
Why? Did something happen?

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.710
Thank you.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.310
Gosh, yes. You did a good thing.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.950
Isn't this great? Good job. Good job.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.070
Where did she go?

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.510
You really did a good thing.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.570
Work hard now.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.490
- Yes, ma'am.
- At ease.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.040
- Take this.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.670
- Wash it.
- I will wash it.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.340
Okay.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.100
- Where are you going, Hyo Ri?
- To Bo Hyeon's.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.240
Bo Hyeon said I need to face my enemy.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.790
Your enemy?

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.480
I'll be right back.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.260
What are you doing?

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.980
Are you here to see me?

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.550
You...

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.550
Take care of your skin, no matter what happens.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.210
I packed the basic and advanced care stuff.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.670
Having this bag at the hospital

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.830
would give you full coverage.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.230
Here.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.630
Do you like me?

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.280
Don't be so sour.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.700
To go surfing in Hawaii, we've
been saving up for three years.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.720
It's a kitty party just for us, bonded by blood,

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.850
but I decided to let you join.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.740
I'll send the bank account number.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.210
After you get back from the hospital,

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.620
deposit 50,000 won on the 13th of each month.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.130
It's an honor.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.920
- Okay.
- Promise.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.390
Promise.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.350
You know, right?

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.510
I don't have many friends.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.830
Come back soon because I'll get bored.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.640
Okay.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.800
Give me a hug to cheer me up, or not.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.700
Forget about it.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.740
Wait for me. Wait for me.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.850
Where are you going?

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.070
- To see my boyfriend.
- Gosh, so annoying.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.800
- Give me your hand.
- Are you crazy?

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.180
- Come.
- It hurts.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.050
Gosh.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:47.510
Do I have to know so much
about my mom's dating life?

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.310
I know. They're like loose children.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.740
I keep worrying about them.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.660
- Done.
- Huh? Okay.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.930
Wait just a second.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.150
Done.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.860
Okay.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.730
- Bo Hyeon.
- Yes.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.330
Let's do a little better.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.200
It's harder than I thought.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.380
I don't know if this is any consolation,

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.030
but I taste a bit more salt this time.

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:38.260
But when your boyfriend cooks for you,

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.700
shouldn't you say, "I like my food blend"
or something like that?

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.810
I don't want to lie to you about anything.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.800
Since we're on the topic...

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.900
The surgery worries and scares me.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.230
After I get the surgery,

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:09.160
I'll be confronting the fact that
I'm sick every day.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.630
Would I be able to handle that?

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.730
How about my mom?

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.150
How about you?

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.690
Would everyone around me be able to handle it?

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.490
It's an unknown world to me.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.320
It scares me so much that it makes me tear up.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.570
I want to cry a lot,

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.260
but I'm holding it in
because I shouldn't cry already.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.440
I'll be crying a lot more from now on.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.880
Crying already would tire me out.

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:10.280
Hyo Ri,

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.740
to be honest,

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:18.670
my biggest fear now is that...

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.500
my clumsy words of comfort or rash
encouragement might burden you.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.700
That's my biggest fear.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.270
It's hard for me to assess how you feel. So...

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.150
To be honest, I'm not sure what I should say.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.570
- It's okay.
- But...

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.060
I know one thing for sure.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.140
I love you the most in this world after Ahjumma.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.200
After the surgery,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.680
if you're scared because
your world changed, talk to me.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.290
And only look at me.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.490
I'll never change.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.090
This is how I feel. So...

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.460
I can tell you that for sure.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.640
Yes.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.730
Did you finish packing?

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.610
Yes, pretty much.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.940
I love you, too.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:02.620
The gas and electricity bills are due next week.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.200
I should tell her to add money
to the bills account.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.360
Ms. Lee, what are you doing here instead
of getting ready to go to Seoul?

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.000
You came. I needed to check
something before I left.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.840
Aigoo. Here's your backup.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.890
Leave everything here and
get ready to go to Seoul.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.340
You must be busy. Thank you so much.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.280
I feel so supported.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.650
While you're gone to Seoul,

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.080
I'll make those two work extra hard

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.860
and double the sales.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.250
I know I shouldn't, but I'll look forward to it.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:37.680
I'll let you.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.670
We'll do a mock test before the surgery to

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:42.100
get familiar with the flow
of the procedure. Don't worry.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.600
I heard you were in medical school.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.670
Yes.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.430
You must know how I feel, then.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.850
I'll make sure to do my best.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:54.200
Let's trust each other and calmly work together.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:55.520
Okay.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.760
There are some complications

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:02.080
you should be aware of after the operation.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.690
During the operation, there could be complications

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:08.720
such as bleeding, seizure, and cerebral edema.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.240
After the operation,

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.500
there could be a language
disability, mental deterioration...

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:34.000
Hello.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.660
Hey, Sook.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.210
Hello.

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:45.020
Hello, Dr. Jung.

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.680
Long time no see.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.730
I'll make sure to cheer Hyo Ri up.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.880
I'll hurry back.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.140
Take your time. There isn't much going on today.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:07.990
Sook.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.490
Hey, why do you look so good in the gown?

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:16.770
I know. Why do I make everything look hip?

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:19.700
Do you have another one?
I think I would look good, too.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.120
What's that?

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:24.100
When you have too much on your mind,

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.890
Sakuragi Hanamichi is the best.

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:30.300
This would be perfect for the next three days.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.140
Time to meet Rukawa again.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.410
It's a problem that the kids
these days don't read books.

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:39.850
Comic books or webtoons are nice,

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:44.470
but read something serious to improve
reading comprehension skills.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:50.080
I was just talking to myself. Don't mind me.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.630
Okay.

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:10.310
Shall we?

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.330
She was a friend who brought me comfort back then.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.130
Cho Rong,

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:43.960
my mom... My mom left me.

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:50.770
It's okay.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:52.630
Again?

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:55.320
Your father did it again?

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.450
It's okay.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:03.550
I have you. So, it's okay.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:08.240
We just felt bad for each other.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.050
We planned to start a hair salon in Seoul.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:13.640
So, we attended a beauty school.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:18.810
But she unexpectedly got pregnant with Hyo Ri.

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:21.450
The baby's father was a hopeless kid.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:25.080
It was obvious what would happen
if her family found out.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.170
So, we ran away to Seoul and had Hyo Ri.

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.370
Lee Hyo Ri was the biggest star then.

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:35.900
I wanted our baby to be as cool as her.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.320
That's why we named her Hyo Ri.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.750
That's how childish we were.

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.500
[Han Cho Rong]

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.720
You're making me feel bad.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.260
Why are you smiling so beautifully?

00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:11.170
It's been too long, hasn't it?

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:18.720
I just couldn't muster up the courage to see you.

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.490
Handkerchief. Hand me the handkerchief.

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:26.910
Hey.

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:28.350
Huh?

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:29.650
Okay.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.040
Here.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:52.090
I'll raise Hyo Ri like a princess.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:59.080
Yes. Let's not raise her like
our parents raised us.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.570
Ji An,

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.510
I won't...

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:13.400
even think about raising her differently
than my parents did or things like that.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:20.600
I'll make sure my Hyo Ri never
finds out how I was raised.

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:23.820
I'll only give her good things.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.290
I'll only make her happy.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.360
I'm serious.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.760
Let's do that.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.740
For sure.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.560
Let's make sure to do that.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.210
Cho Rong,

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.670
I don't think I was able to.

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:07.810
I wanted to...

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:13.240
but I don't think I raised her that way.

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.540
I didn't want to.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.390
But since I'm not a good mom,

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:24.020
I knew nothing.

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.880
Hyo Ri was sick, but I had no idea.

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:34.280
I was too ashamed to come and visit you.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:36.970
Sorry.

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:41.950
I'm sorry, Cho Rong.

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:46.000
But please protect Hyo Ri.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.350
I keep thinking about it,

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:54.230
but you're the only person I could ask.

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:56.850
Cho Rong, please protect...

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:59.910
Please protect our Hyo Ri. Please...

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:09.110
Please protect our Hyo Ri...

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.790
All right. Here they are. Enjoy.

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:40.070
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:42.170
One bossam and two lunch sets.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:44.460
I told them that our bossam is amazing.

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.250
You're the best. Welcome.

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:48.950
- Welcome.
- Have a seat over there.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:53.270
Two lunch sets and bossam.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:49:59.740
Chef.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:03.900
Yes. Yes, I heard. Sorry.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:06.860
Are you okay?

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:10.890
Yes. Ever since Village Leader Go came,

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:13.630
we're getting so many customers. It's hard.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:18.080
Hyo Ri will be okay.

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:20.970
Yes.

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:34.760
Saying, "You must be tired," would be normal.

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:38.680
But I want to ask, "Do you even feel tired?"

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:44.260
Back in my day, I ran a baekban* place briefly.
(Home-made style meal)

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.430
My gosh, because I was reminded of those days,

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:50.240
my old spirit kicked in.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.960
No wonder.

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:59.260
Anyway, I'm tired. But I feel so secure
because you're here.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.350
- Really?
- Yes.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.300
Your body is here, but your heart is in Seoul.

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:21.970
Our Hyo Ri is incredibly strong.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:26.690
And she even went to medical school.

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:35.360
I'm sure she knows a lot more than we do.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:38.330
Why should I worry?

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:42.300
I should be trusting and supporting
her now, and that wouldn't be enough.

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:47.540
You know how people tell me,

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.900
"Ms. Go, you're so strong."

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.690
That I look so easygoing and magnanimous.

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:55.760
People say that often to me.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.180
But in here.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:03.400
Right in here. A fragile girl is living here.

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:08.290
I could tell you're...

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:10.180
similar to me.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:14.010
You don't easily say you're struggling, right?

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.860
But Chef Kim,

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.580
don't live like that.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.030
Pardon?

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:27.320
Stop crying inside.

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.770
Just cry openly.

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:36.730
That way, someone would
hold your hand and hug you.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:39.620
It might not be much,

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:44.470
but you can hear some words of comfort, you know?

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:46.610
Isn't that what affection is?

00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:52.180
Isn't that why we're all living together
like this and nagging each other?

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:53.740
Right?

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.090
Give me Volume 5.

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:25.520
Wow, you read so fast.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.080
I'm a doctor.

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:32.820
Doctors sure are different.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:36.470
Wow. Rukawa is so cool.

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:38.310
How come no one like him exists in real life?

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:39.930
There's Bo Hyeon.

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:47.320
Hey, you got funnier.

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:51.480
Hush. How dare you compare him to Rukawa?

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:55.890
To be honest, Bo Hyeon has
a face you easily get sick of.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:58.200
His face is too tiny.

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:02.200
He doesn't feel like a real man, you know.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.540
Lucky you for having a big manly face.

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.780
My face isn't big. It's medium-sized.

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:15.150
Hi.

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.760
Lee Sook, isn't this your teacher?

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.630
I bet no one messed around with you.

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:28.730
When I was in 10th grade,
a teacher-in-training used to bow to me.

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:32.250
Right. He did that for a whole semester.

00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:33.760
I got caught by the dean,

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.890
so I ran on the track until I threw up.

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:37.810
But it was fun.

00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:41.750
By the way, when was Hyo Ri ever not pretty?

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:45.100
I'm sure I could find some pictures.
But I really don't remember.

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.340
I don't see any.

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.320
Geez. Give me a break.

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.970
This is why I don't date.

00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:53.230
It ruins you.

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:55.080
Geez, seriously.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.380
I'm going to work. Bye.

00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.420
I'll be back tomorrow.

00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.870
I said don't come.

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:03.170
When someone tells me to come, I don't want to go.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:05.080
When someone tells me not to, I want to go.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.620
Hey.

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.300
Dr. Jung.

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:10.980
Buy me something tasty.

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.740
Me? Why?

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.840
I'm so lonely because they're so lovey-dovey.

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:20.340
I'm really sad.

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:22.160
And you're a doctor.

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.060
It's the doctor's treat.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.310
I want something expensive and sweet.

00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:29.290
Or something expensive and filling.

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:32.830
I'll bring you more Slam Dunk volumes.
Let's go. Let's go.

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:46.170
What did you do to me that

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:48.970
I missed you so much when
