00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.598
Miss, what's wrong?

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:13.439
Lian...

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.480
Where's Lian Xinruo?

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:16.239
No, Du Youmeng.

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:18.199
Miss, what are you talking about?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.479
Miss Du hasn't been here today.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.040
No, I saw her.

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:30.279
I knew she had been here.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:31.439
Miss?

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.720
Miss, where are you going?

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:34.879
Miss Xinruo.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.159
Xinruo?

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:39.319
Xinruo?

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.480
Xin...

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.280
Second Master, what's wrong?

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:03.119
She is fine.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.519
Once you're back, adapt as needed.

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.119
Understood.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.520
Second Master, Mr. Jiang,
they've found Miss Lian.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.558
Thank you so much, boss.

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:24.799
Xinruo.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.480
Yuze.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.960
You're not hurt, are you?

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.239
I'm glad you're alright.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.199
Wenyuan said Miss Lian
was caught in a gang shootout.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.360
I wonder how she managed to escape.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.040
Xinruo barely made it out alive.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.039
Why does it sound like
you are questioning her?

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.200
You misunderstood.

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.439
I was only worried about Xinruo.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.879
Let me announce it.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.360
Don't stop me. Step aside.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.759
Fine, you wretch.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.440
How dare you play tricks
and try to scare me!

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:06.879
Lian Xinya.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.719
Miss Xinya.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.719
What do you mean by that?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.079
Did you actually see Xinruo tonight?

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.959
Yes.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.520
Cousin, I never went
to the Lian residence.

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.278
Why are you framing me?

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:16.879
Stop arguing.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.959
I saw you today.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.439
If you really don't believe me,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.640
ask the boss yourself.

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:24.879
That's right.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.319
The young lady has been
in my shop all evening.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.599
Miss,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.159
we're about to close.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.758
Boss, I'm the fiancée
of Second Master Pei.

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:37.838
Please take my token
and run to the Pei residence.

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:39.039
You'll be well rewarded.

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.399
She looked so frightened
that I took the seal

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.399
and went to the Pei residence

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.320
so they could bring her back.

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:53.959
Thank you, sir.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.639
I'll come by another day
to express my gratitude.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.558
Don't mention it, Second Master.

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:00.679
Who knows if you two planned this?

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.559
When the boss went to
the Pei residence with the message,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.999
did any other workers see Miss Xinruo?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.559
Yes.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.399
Everyone in the shop can testify

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.680
that she never left.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.320
Xinruo,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.959
you've had a long day.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.280
Get some rest.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.679
Stop right there.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.880
Lian Xinya.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.999
I won't warn you again.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.600
You'd better learn your lesson.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.000
You...

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.639
What happened this afternoon?

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.159
A group of policemen attacked me.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.880
Luckily, Jin Se showed up in time.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.159
Good.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.280
Wait here a moment.

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:04.479
After that, I had Jin Se
impersonate me and go to

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.679
the tailor shop
while I went to the Lian residence.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.520
Pei Yuze.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.680
What's wrong?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.879
Pei Yuze!

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:13.639
Pei Yuze!

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.800
Pei Yuze!

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.560
Pei Yuze!

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:30.999
I'm fine.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.518
Just low blood sugar.
Can you get me a glass of water?

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:36.479
Sure.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.320
Here.

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:09.039
Thank you.

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.479
You've had a long day.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.038
Go get some rest.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.039
I'm not tired.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:18.199
I was just thinking
of grabbing some food in the kitchen.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.760
Do you want to join me?

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.920
Sure.

00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:24.279
Drink some water.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.038
Hurry, the boat's almost here.

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.439
Move faster.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.120
Careful.

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.838
If you break it, you can't even pay up!

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.879
Miss, bad news!

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.118
Several stewards just reported

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:47.399
that all the stored tea has gone damp.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.680
How could that be?

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.598
Today is the shipping day.

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.838
Miss, what do we do now?

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:55.799
If we can't deliver on time,
we'll have to pay compensation.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.280
Pei Yuze.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.879
Second Master, because of the tea,
Lian Xinya is in a panic.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.558
She even went to ask Pei Yujie for help.

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:06.558
To keep the Lian family calm,

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:09.239
Pei Yujie had no choice
but to cover the loss.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.680
He's taken plenty
from the Lian family over the years.

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:16.080
This is nothing in comparison.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.418
This morning, Lian Xinya even
tried to move her private assets.

00:07:18.418 --> 00:07:19.640
As soon as the boat was loaded,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.880
I had someone switch them
and bring everything back.

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:25.879
Check the inventory.
Set some aside to reward the men.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.840
Got it.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:33.679
Second Master,
I still have things to do.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.880
I'll head off.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.440
What is it?

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.318
You look so pale.

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:46.119
Pei Yuze, are you
hiding something from me?

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:47.679
Why would you think that?

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:50.798
I've asked
several doctors about this pill.

00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:52.959
None of them knows what it does.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.558
I always thought
you were faking an illness.

00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:55.838
Tell me the truth.

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:57.679
Are you really unwell?

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.200
So, you came here to question me.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.198
It's nothing more than a simple tonic.

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.199
A tonic?

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.320
What for?

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:23.599
It strengthens what's weak.

00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:26.639
As for what's weak...

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.240
Do you want to check?

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.120
You...

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.600
What?

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.880
No need to check?

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.240
I still have work.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.240
I'll tell you later tonight.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.360
(I'll find out what this pill does.)

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:30.679
Who's there?

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:34.639
Who is it?

00:10:21.719 --> 00:10:23.358
Miss, you're finally awake.

00:10:23.359 --> 00:10:24.839
Did you have another nightmare?

00:10:25.319 --> 00:10:27.079
Did I have a nightmare again?

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.919
Miss, you...

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.040
What are you...

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.678
Have you heard what happened

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:46.919
to the Lian family?

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.200
Yes. Lian Xinya said she saw a ghost.

00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:52.119
She is now out of her mind.

00:10:53.199 --> 00:10:55.399
She shut herself
in the house to recover.

00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:59.198
Strange how it all
happened right on cue.

00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:02.959
Yao, do you really believe in ghosts?

00:11:03.719 --> 00:11:06.079
I've never believed
in such superstition.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.400
Someone likely pulled a trick on her.

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:13.719
Keep close watch on Du Youmeng.

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:15.479
If she has an alibi,

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.198
then someone must be helping her.

00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:18.759
Find out who it is.

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:22.279
And tonight, go to the Lian Residence.

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:23.839
Understood.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.158
How are things on your end?

00:11:28.159 --> 00:11:30.079
Second Master and Miss Lian
went into the theater.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.599
Second Master booked the whole place.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.800
Not sure when they'll be out.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.879
Keep a close eye on them.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.080
Yes, Mr. Jiang.

00:11:55.159 --> 00:11:56.479
Why is he here?
