[Episode 3]

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.550
Mom,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.350
if you're not comfortable going there,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.940
I'll go to the Zhu family myself.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.100
No need.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.509
I'll go.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.759
I totally respect your decision.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.620
If you don't want to do something,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.000
no one can force you.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.040
Tomorrow I'll tell Mrs. Zhu.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.120
She has to agree.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.430
If anyone dares to bully

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.590
us,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.970
I'll be the first to stand against it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.240
Our family is doing so well now.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.840
Mom.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.920
Well, Siyun.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.590
Look at these fabrics.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.470
The Qiao family sent them
for your casual clothes,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.840
all imported from Paris.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.120
What do you think?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.930
Auntie.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.079
Look.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.710
This is the wedding dress
I designed for you.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.640
Is it beautiful?

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.120
It is designed by you.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.360
It's really beautiful.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.280
The dress is

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.430
not important.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.870
The key point is Siyun's beauty,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.240
elegance,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.400
and figure.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.960
No matter what she wears,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.360
she's the most beautiful girl in Shanghai.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.630
My aunt will definitely be

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.960
the most beautiful bride in Shanghai.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.310
And I'll be

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.240
the happiest brother-in-law in Shanghai.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.870
Mom,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.230
you'll be the happiest mother-in-law
in Shanghai.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.680
Yi,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.410
do you know what this is?

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.180
When one person succeeds,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.510
even his dog and chicken ascend to heaven.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.030
Who's dog and who's chicken?

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.470
I'm the chicken, and you're the dog.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.310
No, no.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.010
I'm the dog, and you're the chicken.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.800
No.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:25.870
I...

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.200
I might not have used
the right expression.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.800
Anyway, you know what I mean.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.870
Happy,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.790
joyful,

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.810
and delighted.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.579
All thanks to Siyun.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.960
Mom.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.900
If there's nothing else,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.230
I'll go upstairs to bed.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.800
Then I'll go upstairs with Auntie too.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.280
Okay.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.840
Alright,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.470
go to bed early, too.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.530
Don't stay up late.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.680
Get some rest.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.840
I'm not in a hurry.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.800
I need to

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.240
gather all the good news

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.300
our family has had.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.120
Tonight,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.910
I want to have a chat with Dad.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.210
Keep your voice down.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.690
Everyone's trying to sleep.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.570
Slow down, Mom.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.000
Come in.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.240
And you are?

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.570
Hello, Under-secretary Dong,

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.720
my name is Lin Siyun.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.190
Old Shen mentioned you.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.950
Come on.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.600
Please have a seat, Miss Lin.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600
Please, sit down.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.980
Old Shen

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.970
didn't lie to me.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.270
Miss Lin,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.510
you are truly

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.720
beautiful

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.240
and captivating.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.300
Have you reviewed

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.560
my documents?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.830
All the official stamps required

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.390
for this approval document are complete.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.330
Your hospital

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.890
can now open for business.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.680
Thank you.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.680
When the hospital opens,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.800
please come with your wife
to honor us with your presence.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.480
Sure.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.610
Look,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.430
it's

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.560
lunchtime already.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.390
Miss Lin, if you're free,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.920
would you join me for a meal?

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.310
I

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.800
have some hospital matters
to deal with,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.930
so I'll have to pass.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.800
Well, next time then.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.190
Let's have lunch together next time.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.260
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.850
Okay.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.040
Goodbye.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.720
Goodbye.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.600
Cheng Ao.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.270
You work here?

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.850
Yes.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.170
Who are you?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.280
I'm Shen Yiqun's little sister.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.490
Shen Fangfang?

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.560
My name is Shen Yingying.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.680
I'm sorry.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.780
Shen Yingying,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.210
long time no see.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.660
Your gang's office is really nice.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.159
This is a legitimate law firm.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.330
But Yiqun said you're in a gang.

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:38.000
My family is involved with gangs,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.760
but

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.040
I'm a lawyer.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.090
Then let me have a look around.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.130
I have a client inside.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.800
Do you have any case

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.050
that needs my help?

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.340
Can't I see you without having a case?

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.540
If you want cases, my father has plenty.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.310
He can make you the most famous lawyer

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.640
in Shanghai overnight.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.070
Think about it.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.920
You lied to me.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.350
There's no client at all.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.490
Where's my client?

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.670
I'm in a good mood, so I'll forgive you.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.350
Nice chair.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.640
I'm really curious about you.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.760
Yinqun says you're a gang member,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.290
but you say you're a lawyer.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.510
Who should I believe?

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.480
I'll believe you,

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.560
since Yiqun never tells the truth.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.600
Are you free tomorrow?

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.310
I'd like to treat you to coffee.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.310
I have two cases to handle tomorrow.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.510
Then the day after tomorrow?

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.310
I have two cases that day as well.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.310
Then, choose one of these days

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.430
and cancel your original arrangement.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.630
As for my four cases,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.560
if I don't handle two of them,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.890
someone will go to jail.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.540
If I don't handle the other two,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.000
someone will go bankrupt.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.680
How about this?

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.010
You help me choose a day,

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:06.920
and decide which one to cancel,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.520
so I can have coffee with you.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.770
Never mind.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.520
Men always prioritize their careers.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.830
I respect you

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.160
and understand you.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.520
I'll come back in a few days
to make an appointment with you.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.220
Goodbye.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.200
I'll take this place.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.970
When should I pay the deposit?

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.980
You're quite the impatient one.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.710
You can pay the deposit tomorrow
or the day after.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.440
My husband told me

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.730
that you're planning to open a hospital.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.570
Yes.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:42.960
A maternity hospital.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.360
Since you've married into the Qiao family,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.390
why work so hard?

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.520
Why don't you enjoy being a noble lady?

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.580
It's good for a woman to work hard.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:52.630
I don't understand.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.950
I suppose everyone has
their own way of living.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:55.460
Yes,

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.200
everyone has their own way.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.200
What are you doing, Siyun?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.260
Come down quickly!

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.000
The wedding is tomorrow.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.800
Hurry down and try on your dress.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.360
Coming, Mom.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.420
Siyun, listen to me,

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:34.870
from now on,

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:35.910
you can only drink water.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.600
You can't eat anything else, understand?

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.200
All these clothes are custom-tailored.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.240
Even the slightest change will make
them not fit properly.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.320
Look at this wedding dress.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:43.910
How is it?

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.150
Beautiful, right?

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.630
-Auntie.
-Try on the wedding dress first.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.240
Auntie,

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.070
there's a letter for you.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.580
[To Qin]

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.560
Who delivered this letter?

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.000
I don't know. I don't recognize him.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.400
He just said it was urgent

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.000
and told you to read it yourself.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.510
What are you doing?
Try on the clothes first.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.100
I'll come down after reading this letter,
Mom.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.550
Well, hurry up then.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.580
Who sent it?

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.230
I don't know who he is.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.040
Boss,

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.330
the letter has been delivered
to the Lin family's servant.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.200
Qin,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.320
since we parted this morning,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.200
my heart has been restless.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.750
My marriage to Miss Lin

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.750
is entirely due to my father's orders,

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.410
and I have no feelings for her.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.700
Please don't be upset about this.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.030
You're the only one in my heart.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.840
I've thought it through carefully.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.150
After you graduate from high school,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.030
if you want to continue your studies,

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.600
I'll arrange for you to study abroad,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.460
and we'll go to America together.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.100
If you don't want to continue studying,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.670
I'll buy you a house

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.320
and settle you down.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.480
I

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.890
will definitely give you proper status.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.930
Until then, don't overthink things.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.200
Take good care of yourself,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.840
and be sure to eat well

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.270
and rest well.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.950
I will surely make you happy.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:18.960
I love you.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.090
Your forever love,

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.500
Shijun.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.240
Siyun.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.320
Mom wants you to come down
and try on your clothes.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.050
Why aren't you coming down yet?

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.200
Sis,

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.240
please tell my mom.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.200
I won't try on the wedding dress now.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.890
I'm going to find Qiao Shijun.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.150
In such a hurry?

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.840
You two are really close.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.940
You're getting married tomorrow,

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.960
and you still want to see him today.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.890
I've been through this before.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.890
Women shouldn't be too eager,

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.710
but let your man be the eager one.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:07.960
Siyun.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.770
Can you accept that I have other women

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:12.970
after we are married?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I can guarantee

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.890
they will respect you,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.240
and as for all the money you need,

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.670
I'll let you manage it.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.270
When we met,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.360
you told me you were
a progressive young man

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.880
who hates those outdated traditions.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.440
Why did you lie to me?

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.790
Siyun, you are

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.490
taking this too seriously.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.030
You weren't like this
when you were younger.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.560
I've always been like this.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.410
People always make progress.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.810
In my relationship,

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.550
I want us to love each other equally,

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.910
with no room for the third one.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.300
So you're trying to change my views?

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.090
Not at all.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.500
I won't try to change anyone's views.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.200
There's no point.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.660
What do you want to do then?

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.110
We're not married yet.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.360
You mean you want
to break off the engagement?

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.870
Should we tell the public it is you
who end it, or me?

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:20.840
Be honest.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.480
Be honest?

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.150
Siyun, you're being too naive.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.600
Given your family's current situation,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.770
we can still get married

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.570
because first

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.000
when we were children,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.790
your father and my father arranged
our betrothal,

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.450
and second,

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.650
I love you.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.270
Otherwise,

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.370
I have many other options.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.320
Be my wife.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.720
You'll gain more than what you'll lose.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.450
My love isn't a business transaction.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.260
Siyun,

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.530
you're too arrogant,

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.440
which will make you suffer loss.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.720
I'm willing to suffer loss.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.720
Won't you think about your brother?

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.310
If you break off the engagement,

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.700
he won't be able to pay back
a single cent.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.870
That's his problem.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.790
Fine.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.670
I was wrong.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.250
What do you mean?

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.630
We're not right for each other.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.400
We are right for each other.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.440
Please don't be so stubborn.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.600
Stop making a scene,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.240
okay?

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.180
Don't touch me.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.260
Okay, I won't touch you.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.120
Let me tell you, with your temper,

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.390
no man in Shanghai will like you.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.520
That's my business.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.370
You should go now.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.060
Go home.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.430
I'll give you one night
to think it through.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.840
I know you're impulsive right now.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:58.360
Hello,

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.030
Cheng Ao from Pingzheng Law Firm.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.240
It's me, Lu Yingchen.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:02.760
Tomorrow's front page will be

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.840
"Dai Xi's personal account
of living with Shen Yiqun",

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.120
with text and photos.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.240
The article has already gone to print.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.170
Has the printing started already?

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.330
I'm not sure.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.520
Don't blame me.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.550
I noticed it just now.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.680
I've been out chasing stories all day.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.260
Alright, got it.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.030
Cheng.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.720
Shen Yiqun.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.160
Read the newspaper.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.430
[Secret Story Between a Prostitute
& a Senior Official]

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.890
All these newspapers have been taken away

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.670
and the printing plates were destroyed.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.510
They've called the police,

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:52.970
so handle it as you see fit.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.390
This is the payment for those newspapers.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:01.120
Make sure it's transferred to the factory
and newspaper office before knocking off.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.390
You two politicians

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.870
use a pregnant woman
as a pawn in your games.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:05.930
Is that dignified?

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.460
Dignity has no place in politics.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.910
But

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.410
it's quite enjoyable.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:15.780
Let me ask you,

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.360
in your opinion,

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.030
how will

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.870
Dai Xi's issue develop

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.320
and how should it be resolved?

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.120
That's easy.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.930
You're not married.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:28.280
Why don't you marry her?

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.380
Stop joking, bro.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.780
Let me teach you what politics is.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.460
There's only one consequence for Dai Xi.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.760
When Liu thinks she's no longer useful,

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:39.680
he'll kill her.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.850
There's another possibility.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.490
If Dai Xi causes more trouble,

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.030
you'll kill her,

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.160
right?

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.190
I didn't say that.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.200
You did.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.099
Transfer the money promptly.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.730
Have a seat.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.270
Have a seat.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:26.780
What are you staring at?

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.270
Bro.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.390
We're back.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.310
What do you want?

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.670
What do you want?

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.270
Do you really think Liu and Shen

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.280
would turn against each other
because of you?

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.830
You're too naive.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.070
Didn't you hear what he said?

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.140
If Liu doesn't kill you,

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.720
then, Shen will.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.360
Wasn't there a knife at your kidney today?

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.960
Keep quiet and follow me.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.400
Do you know who wants her?

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.830
I don't care.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.960
Get lost now.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:36.590
Are you saying

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.160
that person today

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.490
works for Liu?

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.960
Why are you talking so much?

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.480
Are you stupid?

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.440
Tomorrow Shen will

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.170
threaten you with a knife, too.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:17.240
Let's go.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.110
Are you waiting for me to hold you?

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.070
Come on.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.590
Stop dawdling.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.030
Bro.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.410
Do we have to help Dai Xi?

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:42.650
We gave her money

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.440
and helped her leave safely.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.170
What are we getting out of this?

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.630
Let's go.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.040
Mom.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.740
The Qiao family is indeed a noble family.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.320
These betrothal gifts

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.180
are wonderful.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:11.920
Yes, indeed.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.830
Hello.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.490
Who's this?

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:23.590
Uncle Qiao.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.040
This is Jinghan.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.600
Go ahead.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.120
No.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.670
I understand.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:36.850
Don't worry.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:39.990
I'll handle it properly.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.070
Why are you crying?

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.310
What did Uncle Qiao say to you?

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.510
Mom.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.460
Could you please call Lin Siyun for me?

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.550
Siyun.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.960
Siyun, come down here quickly.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.120
Uncle Qiao called.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.010
Is what he said true?

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:35.640
Yes.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.250
I'm kneeling for you.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:44.880
I'm begging you.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.280
You don't need to

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.430
worry about the schoolgirl.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:49.810
She has no status whatsoever.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.060
She's a nobody,

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.440
and you never have to see her again.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:54.830
Uncle Qiao said

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.030
even if she has a baby in the future,

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.090
she won't compete with you
for the family inheritance.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.650
I'm begging you.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:05.830
Get up.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:07.480
Don't do this.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.210
If I get up, will you promise me?

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.550
Will you?

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:23.650
Siyun.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.400
I'm asking you to do this

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:27.930
not for myself,

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.900
not for the Lin family,

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:31.640
but for you.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.230
If you break off the engagement,

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.200
your reputation will be ruined.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:38.170
Really.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.800
Jianghan.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:46.920
I understand.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.680
Siyun,

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.640
I understand you.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.470
Many couples

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.070
are just for show.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.720
Turning a blind eye to problems,

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.240
that's how life goes by.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.920
We're women.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.790
Sis,

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.590
I know that.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.280
What on earth happened?

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.670
What's going on?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.830
What schoolgirl?

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:13.350
Mom,

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.210
you don't need to know that.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.530
You just have to know that
Siyun understands what's important,

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.150
and she's my dear sister.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.830
Young Master,

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.630
Mr. Qiao is waiting in the study.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.350
Good.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.160
Be good.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.230
You're the best.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:44.990
Jinghan.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.470
You don't need to pull me.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:48.780
I can walk by myself.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.450
You're really my sweetie sister.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.040
Here comes my brother-in-law!

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.640
Look how well Siyun is doing.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.640
And you

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.250
look quite spirited, too.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.160
Look how cute Siyun is when she smiles.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.490
You two lovebirds should have a good chat,

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.160
and work things out.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.150
Alright.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.440
Siyun.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.750
It's been a night now.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.080
Are you feeling better?

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.110
I'm better,

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.210
and I've thought things through.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:43.830
That's good.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.770
Couples shouldn't hold grudges overnight.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.830
Can you give me a hug?

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.320
Okay.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.310
I love you very much.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.770
I promise I'll treat you well from now on.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.160
Let's have a good life together, okay?

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.630
Young Master,

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.600
look at this.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.030

[A Young Master Raises 15-Year-Old Girls,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.880
You did this?

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:52.720
You played a trick, huh?

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.160
Take it however you want.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.480
Lin Siyun.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.440
You'll pay for this,

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.130
as do your brother,

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.160
your mother, your sister-in-law, and Yi.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.440
None of them will escape.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.480
Qiao Shijun,

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.160
you still don't understand me.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.680
I keep my word.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.110
You'll regret this.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.570
I never do anything
without thinking it through.

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.410
Are you crazy?

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.720
Hearing your curse,

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.170
I actually find you more genuine.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:36.510
Meeting a woman like you,

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.350
I'm really unlucky.

Dear Dan.

Dear Huimin.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.030
Dear Luoyuan.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:06.830
Dear Xiaojun.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:17.680
Nice writing.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.070
You've got quite a lot darlings.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.680
Where did you find

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.030
all these letters?

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.620
That's none of your business.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.130
You gave Lin Siyun the letter, right?

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:27.720
Yes.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.670
Did you also damage my car?

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:32.370
Yes.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.360
Do you need a ride?

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.540
You can take my car,

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:36.670
and I can walk back.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.010
No, thanks. I'll walk.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:40.510
Wait.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.960
Don't you want your letters?

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.690
Yes, I do.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.930
What do you mean?

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.140
Check them again?

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.000
It has to be careful
when dealing with politicians.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:15.220
Cheng.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:17.360
Here you are.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:18.660
Thanks, Ao.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.450
It's from me.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.240
Politician is just my social identity,

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.750
but privately, we're close friends,

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.110
who completely trust each other,

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.720
right?

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:35.960
Cheng.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.350
Come work for me.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.200
Stop kidding, Director.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.830
I am doing well working for Ao.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.030
See how stubborn he is,

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.960
just like him.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.060
I took a look when I came up.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.410
There's not a single client here.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.240
Cheng Ao.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.100
The location of

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.380
the house is perfect.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.650
The rent must be expensive, right?

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.030
With such a chaotic situation,

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.360
business must be tough.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.730
Don't worry,

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.330
I've paved the way for you.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.140
Come work in my department.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.640
Let's work together as a team.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.190
I assure you that
you'll be a director next year.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:07.830
No need for your concern, Shen.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:08.690
In my business,

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.890
different times bring different cases.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.240
I'm just doing my small business,

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.000
focusing on my own job.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.110
Political affairs

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.030
are too grand for me.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.330
Only outstanding persons like you

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:21.910
can handle such matters.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.650
Actually,

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.930
if you work for me,

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.720
you just change your work environment.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.940
But the clients you serve
would be different.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:33.800
Think about it.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:34.700
Who do you

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.480
serve every day here?

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.480
Tom,

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:38.610
Dick and Harry,

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:39.440
right?

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.720
In my department,

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.070
we serve the country.

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:43.860
The strategic vision and elevated thinking

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.060
will be worlds apart.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.000
Let me ask you something.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.640
Go ahead.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.800
Are you serving the country,

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.390
or Chairman Jiang?

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.750
First, we serve Chairman Jiang well.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.080
Didn't you just say you serve the country?

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.430
Shen.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.070
I really can't work for you.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.200
First,

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.610
I'm not that slick.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:13.720
Second,

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.730
my methods aren't that ruthless.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:18.400
Third,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.350
I can't tell lies.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.930
Wouldn't you be nervous

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.040
with me

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.080
working by your side?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.260
You're now a director,

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.310
and your dream is to be a bureau chief.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.590
After I join you,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.450
you might become a section chief,

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:35.580
or even just a clerk.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:37.860
Is it worth it?

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.870
The loss outweighs the gain.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:42.760
Cheng Ao.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.440
The more you reject me,

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.440
the more I feel

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.080
that I need you so badly.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.070
Enough. I have several cases.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:52.010
Why don't you investigate them with me?

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:53.940
I can't understand those things anyway.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.710
Alright then,

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:55.510
get some rest.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.610
Cheng,

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:57.940
see him out.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.940
Director, please.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.640
Please reconsider.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:14.080
Lin Siyun.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.670
You're a witch.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.110
Lin Jinghan.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.020
What are you doing?

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.220
Nothing.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.770
I just want you to kick this chair for me.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.880
If you keep this up,
I'm calling the police.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.510
Go ahead.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.310
Call the police.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.690
Let all people in Shanghai see

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.880
what a shameless woman

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.940
the Lin family has.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:51.720
Or just get out.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.440
Do you even know how to get out?

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.970
Put your hands on your head,

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.840
crouch down,

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:58.680
push forward,

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.070
and get out.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.310
This is my home. I live here.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.040
You know this is your home, huh?

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:09.640
You!

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:10.890
Come over

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.490
and kick this chair for me.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.800
Or I'll beat you to death tonight.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:20.880
Lin Jinghan,

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.160
you want to beat a woman?
Are you even a man?

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:23.880
I'm not.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.000
You drove me to this.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:28.110
But

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.170
even as a ghost, I won't let you go.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.400
It's said that

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:34.670
a leader must be large-hearted.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.160
Mr. Qiao just has several mistresses.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.240
What happened to your tolerance?

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.540
Did someone eat it?

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.480
I can't be that tolerant.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.230
Mom.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:51.680
Siyun,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.260
please help Jianghan.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:55.440
Sis,

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.880
let's go upstairs.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.640
No,

00:32:58.450 --> 00:32:59.610
I can't go up there.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.750
If I do so,

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.480
he'll beat me to death tonight.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.320
Jinghan.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.200
I'm coming to save you.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:16.160
Come on.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:17.610
Don't hold me.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.030
You'll push the chair over.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:19.690
Don't move.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.400
Step back.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.810
I'll get down by myself.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.350
Lin Siyun.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:33.790
Wait and see.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:37.310
Jinghan.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.180
Where did you get that chair from?

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.680
I'll take it back for you.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.440
And you,

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.880
when I asked you to kick my chair,

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.010
why didn't you do it?

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.520
Wait and see.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:03.400
Ling.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.160
I told you

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:06.300
to hire midwives,

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.680
How's that going?

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.150
We've hired two already.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:10.409
We still need one more.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.199
It seems impossible to find
someone suitable.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.110
No rush,

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.340
take your time.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.790
By the way,

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.590
Dr. Lin,

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:21.550
do you know who came

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.400
to apply after I posted

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:24.960
the job notice today?

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:27.230
Who?

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.710
The mother-in-law
of the lying-in woman in bed five,

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:30.590
Mrs. Chen.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.080
She said

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:34.230
that modern delivery methods are
popular now,

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.630
and those wealthy ladies

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:36.840
don't seek their services anymore,

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.320
leaving them with only poor clients

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.710
or high-risk cases.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.690
After seeing how you saved
her daughter-in-law,

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.510
she said your methods are effective

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.000
and wanted to be your assistant

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.070
to learn from you.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.199
What did you tell her?

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.400
I refused on your behalf, of course.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.110
Look,

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.000
you just performed a C-section
on her daughter-in-law,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.150
and she immediately asked you

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.030
if her daughter-in-law could still have

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.480
other babies,

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.430
which shows your thoughts
are totally different.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:02.510
Next time you see her,

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.800
ask her to come over.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.200
I'd like to talk with her.

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:06.630
Really?

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.590
You see,

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.560
even a traditional midwife

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:12.800
is adapting.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.650
One's mind can be changed.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.630
Alright,

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.110
I'll tell her next time.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:25.150
Yi.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:31.520
Sis.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:40.920
Where are they?

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.190
Yu.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:48.830
Miss, what can I do for you?

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:49.920
Where's my family?

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:54.840
Say something.

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:57.390
I heard from Young Madam

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.960
that Miss Yi is getting engaged today,

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.620
and her in-laws are willing to help
Young Master pay off his debts.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.560
Where are they?

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.920
Mr. and Mrs. Zhu,

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.510
and Senior Mrs. Zhu,

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.960
let me say something

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.890
as a modest spur.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.090
Today is truly a wonderful day,

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.710
a joyous occasion.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:24.840
My daughter Yi

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.030
is well-educated.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:28.920
She has learnt about all the classics,

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.070
Zuo's Commentary,
Spring and Autumn Annals,

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:30.920
as well as

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:32.170
natural sciences,

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:33.430
like species evolution.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:34.780
She picks things up

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.070
very quickly.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.170
Dad, why are you keeping talking about me?

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.480
It is the first time meeting
Senior Mrs. Zhu,

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.740
so I want to praise you.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.400
The Zhu family

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.150
values

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.230
being benevolent, righteous,
courteous, wise, and trustworthy.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:53.070
Most importantly,
their financial situation is quite good,

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:53.760
isn't it, Senior Mrs. Zhu?

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.510
What does it have to do with me?

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.420
Just a chat.

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.880
Mom, what is Dad talking about?

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:05.260
Darling.

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.120
Yi is asking you.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:08.190
Tell her.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.710
Yi.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.710
Your father wants you to live
a happy life.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.030
Just listen to him.

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.080
Your in-laws have promised

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:17.840
that they'll cover all
your education expenses

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.030
from now on.

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:21.020
My in-laws?

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.800
Grandma, what are they talking about?

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.960
Yi.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:31.080
Be good.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:32.030
Be obedient.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.590
Xiong is a good boy.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.920
Your mother-in-law

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.120
and grandmother-in-law are very nice.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:39.760
They will treat you well.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.320
You want to study, and your mother-in-law
has promised

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.150
to support your studies abroad.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.170
Do you know about this?

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.820
Yes, you're my wife.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:49.970
Who told you that?

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.960
My grandma.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.360
You shouldn't tell him so.

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:57.440
I have no idea at all

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.170
and suddenly I became his wife.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.510
Yi.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.190
Don't you remember what I taught you?

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.960
Be respectful to elders

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:06.570
and mind your tone.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.590
Sir,

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.470
doesn't Yi know she's getting
married into our family?

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:12.280
She knew.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.070
I didn't know.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.210
Go talk to her,

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:19.070
and persuade her.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.150
What's going on?

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.160
Senior Mrs. Zhu,

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.440
don't worry,

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.240
I'll have a chat with her.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.650
Here, let me pour you wine.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.200
You're asking for trouble.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.440
How dare you?

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.630
Get up there!

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:42.320
You dare defy me in front of others?

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.070
Dare you defy me?

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.070
Dare you do it again?

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:44.920
Get up there.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.580
Kneel down!

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:46.710
You don't appreciate my kindness, right?

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:47.760
You never cherish your chance.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.280
I won't.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:49.230
What?

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.980
I won't marry him.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.800
I paid for your education
and this is how you repay me?

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.230
You dare talk back to me in public?

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.320
Defy me? Dare you glare at me again?

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.320
I won't marry him.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.360
I'll kick you!

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.400
Try that again!

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.200
I'll kick you!

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.230
Stop hitting her!

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:03.940
Where did you come from?

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.910
Who are you?

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.480
None of your business.
Just stop hitting her.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.230
You are nosy.

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:09.560
Do not poke your nose
where it doesn't belong.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.650
Get out of the way!

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:13.560
Let go of me!

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:14.810
Ouch! Ouch!

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.190
If you hit her again,
I'll teach you a lesson.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:18.510
It hurts!

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.000
Let go!

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.210
Are you okay, Miss?

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.190
That's what you get for showing off.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:36.920
Try twisting my arm again!

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.230
Dare you to try that again!

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.600
Meddle in others' business, huh?

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.730
Dare you do it again?

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.440
Lin Jinghan!

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:42.920
Dare you do it again?

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.920
Stop!

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.700
This is the concession area.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.090
If you smash his head

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.500
and get arrested by the police,

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.440
you'll go to jail.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.760
Don't give me that nonsense.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.360
I've weathered all kinds of storms.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.820
Go ahead, call the police.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:58.590
You are the shame of the Lin family.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:39:59.530
Are you okay?

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.390
It's fine now.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.050
It should be here.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.670
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.930
I didn't feel the pain before,

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:30.860
but now it's starting to hurt a bit.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.110
I'm sorry.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.450
Thank you for today.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:35.200
Here you are.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.240
-What's your name?
-What's your name?

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.760
I'm Yi.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.800
Nice to meet you.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.030
Zhou Zhaoyuan.

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:54.830
I'm her aunt.

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:56.320
Hello.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.700
Mom, I'm home.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.060
Mom?

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:15.670
Yi, come here.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.190
Sit down.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:26.550
Yi.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.840
Don't blame your father.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.260
Your aunt destroyed this family.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.590
Your father had no choice but to do so.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.710
He did it for our family,

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.470
and for you.

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:41.910
Do you understand?

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:47.800
Lin Siyun, come here.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.030
I don't understand.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.950
You called off your perfect marriage
with Mr. Qiao

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.630
and ruined Yi's marriage.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:05.490
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:08.320
Who's really in charge of this family?

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:10.800
How have we wronged you

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.510
that you treat us this way?

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.240
You are a woman.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:18.360
You should do what you're supposed to do.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.640
Mom,

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.030
please tell Lin Jinghan

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.630
that the Zhu family's bride price

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.160
should be returned in full.

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.340
From today on, Yi

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:31.600
will live with me

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:34.230
and I'll pay for her living expenses

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.360
and tuition fees.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.320
How can you be so selfish?

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:45.700
Why do I have such a selfish daughter?

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.110
Yi,

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:48.590
come upstairs with me.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.030
Yi, sit down.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:51.250
Mom.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.310
Listen to your grandmother.

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:55.080
I want to listen to Auntie.
