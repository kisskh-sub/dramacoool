[Footprints of Change]

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.759
[Episode 13]

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.039
How did you know that woman?

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.800
Just mind your own business.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.600
You can't act like that,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.600
my dear minister.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.380
That's not very gentlemanly of you.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.840
A female comrade

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.570
brought you noodles,
and you wouldn't even eat them.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.280
She wanted to treat you to dinner,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.560
and you pulled a face

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.970
even longer than mine.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.030
Enough.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.800
I've given you enough respect already.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.730
I'm warning you—

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.590
this Huang Lingling

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.120
doesn't seem simple at all.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.200
Our army just entered the city.

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.190
There are plenty of women like her

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.400
from the old regime.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.470
Why don't you just say

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.400
that Huang Lingling's a KMT agent?

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.480
Fine, so my kindness counts for nothing.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.000
From now on,

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.650
I won't get involved in your messes.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.220
You really don't need to.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.860
Are you back to your old habits again?

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.560
You just got to Shanghai

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.340
and you're already dazzled?

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.750
What?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.750
You just had to bring that up,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.560
didn't you?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.600
You know what?

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.520
From now on,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.110
I won't get involved
in your love life at all.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.240
You'll just be alone

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.900
for the rest of your life.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.560
Yi Yi.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.910
Yi Yi.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.880
Come down.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.130
They said you were sick,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.850
so I came to check on you.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.710
Don't be so nervous.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.630
I'm not here on behalf of myself.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.290
I'm here on behalf of the organization...

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.960
to check on you.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.520
I'm not nervous.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.970
I've got nothing left anyway.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.970
If you want to hate me,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.920
then go ahead.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.550
If you want me to feel sorry

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.680
or guilty,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.780
then you're wrong.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.190
I owe you nothing.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.630
Those things you wrote,

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.070
if I hadn't seen them, it'd be fine.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.720
But I did,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.920
and I had to report it.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.250
That's discipline.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.680
I don't hate you.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.430
I just feel a little pity for you.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.950
Why do you feel pity for me?

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.659
You're just pretending
to be something you're not.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.510
Lucky for you, Minister Wen

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.510
is educated

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.570
and broad-minded.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.510
If it were anyone else,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.090
who knows how they'd handle
someone like you.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.240
I've delivered the organization's regards.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.300
I'll get going now.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.430
Medicine!

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.750
Didn't you have stomach problems before?

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.880
Zhaoyuan used to...

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.460
You know how to cook it, right?

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.040
Slow simmer, remember.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.070
Thank you.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.159
The organization has reviewed your case

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.040
and decided to deal with it
through criticism and education.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.030
You need to write a self-criticism report,

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.960
then it won't go on your record.

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:48.159
Thank you, Ma'am.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.680
But,

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.630
don't think you're in the clear

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.090
just because this is over.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.040
You must actively participate in

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.159
the political study sessions
organized by the trade union.

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.720
As an intellectual from the old era,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.920
if you want to keep up with the new times,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.280
you need to change your attitude,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.360
and firmly stand

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.600
with the working class.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.620
Thank you, Ma'am.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.130
But I don't have a unit now.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.620
The organization has arranged
a job for you.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.470
Anhua Workshop
has established a night school.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.180
You'll be responsible

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.600
for teaching the cultural courses there.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.560
This job

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.430
will also help you
have a deeper understanding

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.070
of the workers

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.870
and benefit from their assistance.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.930
Your appointment letter.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.659
Here you are.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.720
Take it!

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.930
Aren't you going to say thank you?

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.480
Say "Thank you, Ma'am."

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.790
Thank you, Ma'am.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.560
Ms. Yi.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.310
I know all about your situation.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.570
I just want to tell you—

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.090
don't lose hope.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.390
I have no hope left.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.090
Mine is already shattered.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.250
I'm sorry.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.060
I'm complaining again.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.180
It won't happen again.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.130
Actually,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.330
the moment you chose to
hand over your diary,

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.220
you should've known this could happen.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.210
Did I have any other choice?

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:51.290
Of course you did.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.610
You could have

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.020
refused to hand it over

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.370
or destroyed it.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.310
I handed over my diary

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.510
because I felt I had nothing to hide.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.120
And I believed that...

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.820
eventually, some leader would understand.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:11.870
Your personality

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.720
made you choose the hardest path

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.950
for yourself.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.030
Do you know what's hardest for me?

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.000
Your dignity.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.120
Your privacy.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.100
I know these things are...

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.830
more precious than life itself

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.710
to an intellectual.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.539
Am I right?

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.410
The new China has only been
established for 5 years,

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.140
and there's so much to rebuild.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.600
Some things

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.150
we haven't done well,

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.170
and some cadres have been insensitive.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.170
These are objective facts.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.660
But overall,
the new China is making good progress—

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.930
it's positive and upbeat.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:05.720
So,

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.760
you need to be more optimistic,

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.790
alright?

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.910
For those of you doing great things,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.320
the times and history

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.480
may allow you to make mistakes.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.540
No mistakes should be allowed.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.510
We must avoid them as best we can.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.940
I heard from Fu Zihe

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.000
that thanks to your persistence,

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.050
I wasn't given harsh punishment,

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.570
nor was it recorded in my file.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.890
Thank you.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.200
That was

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.430
the organization's decision.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.460
Then thanks to the organization.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.750
Director.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:03.840
I'll take this call then.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.500
Go ahead.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:07.870
Hello.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.960
Mr. Yang isn't here.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.510
What?

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:35.840
Zhou,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.070
I retrieved these files for you.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.230
What's wrong?

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.110
Director,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.290
Mr. Yang's mother has passed away.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.530
Don't tell him yet.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.790
Mr. Yang.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.480
Director.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.350
What's wrong?

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.590
Well,

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.410
Mr. Yang,

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.400
there was a call from your home.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:19.800
Mom!

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:21.730
Mom!

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.000
I failed you, Mom.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.470
Mom... I didn't get
to see you one last time.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:00.330
Lad.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:02.530
Young lad.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.730
Your mother wouldn't blame you.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.910
She'd surely be proud of her son.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:13.980
Do you hear me?

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.390
Good lad.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.960
My heart aches...

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.030
Zhou.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.650
Zhou.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.960
Take him to the station.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.480
Just use the unit car.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.190
After the first
seven days of mourning...

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.980
Yang, once that's over,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.720
finish your family matters
and then come back.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.150
Sisters,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.730
our workshop's night school
officially starts today.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.670
The leadership has appointed Ms. Yi

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.600
as our teacher.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.670
She'll teach us reading, writing,
and cultural courses.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.930
Everyone, let's give her a warm welcome.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.100
Before we begin the class,

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.080
let's first share our own stories.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.630
Let's talk about our lives

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.320
before and after Liberation.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.870
Who wants to go first?

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.440
-Me!
-Me!

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.610
I didn't expect you all
to be this enthusiastic.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.020
Then let's have Qiu speak on our behalf

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.600
and share with everyone.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.390
That way Ms. Yi
can get to know everyone better.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:27.870
Come on.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.840
Well,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.800
when I was 10 years old,

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.670
my parents starved to death.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.240
After that, my uncle
sold me to an opera troupe.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.250
He used the money from selling me
to pay for my parents' burial.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.440
At the troupe, I worked every day

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.670
yet still got beaten.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.920
I didn't learn anything useful.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:56.720
Later,

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.910
the troupe leader sold me again

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.200
to a wealthy old lady as a maid.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.840
The old lady beat me,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.840
pinched me, and yanked my hair every day.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.290
I was covered in bruises.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.990
If it weren't for the Communist Party,

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.720
I would've died 100 times.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.670
Xiurong,

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.830
only in the new society

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.990
did I finally feel like a human being.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.520
I love working here.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.550
I love my sisters.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.840
I love Xiurong.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.480
I love Ms. Yi, too.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.320
Qiu,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.150
don't be sad.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.840
Those bitter days are over!

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.000
Right, sisters?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.200
-Yes.
-That's right.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.670
Now let's have Ms. Yi begin the class.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.220
Come here.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.570
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.600
Today I'll talk about
tie-dye craftsmanship.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.800
Your voice is too low!
We can't hear you.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.680
Ms. Yi, please speak up.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.000
That's right!

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.910
Tie-dye craftsmanship

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.840
is part of
our traditional hand-dyeing techniques.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.110
It can be traced back as early

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.120
as the Eastern Jin Dynasty.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.790
Later, people began
applying this technique.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.590
Minister Wen?

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.440
What brings you here?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.080
Welcome, welcome.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.790
I heard

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.640
Ms. Yi would be teaching today,

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.900
so I came to take a look.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:40.680
Well,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.700
how's the class going?

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:44.670
Ms. Yi,

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.270
you're not nervous, are you?

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.000
I remember back in Yan'an,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.660
the first time I gave a speech,

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.680
facing that sea of people,

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.390
I was nervous too.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.600
It'll get better gradually.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.810
Minister Wen, since you're already here,

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.720
why don't you say a few words too?

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.960
No, this is a classroom,

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.069
not a meeting room.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:07.550
You should be listening

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.440
to Ms. Yi, not me.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.030
Please, say a few words.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.349
We want to learn cultural courses,

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:12.270
and we also want to hear from you.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:14.810
Alright, I'll just say a few words.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.750
The old society turned people into ghosts,

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.340
and the new society
turned ghosts back into people.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.510
Without the Communist Party,

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.040
there would be no new China.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.600
Sisters,

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.160
fellow workers,

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.980
one day I hope

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.750
I can call you all

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.330
comrades.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.310
Bravo!

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.100
I want to ask a question.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.390
What did we fight for

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.030
and shed blood for?

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.680
It was to build a new world.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.000
In this new world,

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.950
there will be no oppression.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.270
All the oppressed

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.210
will rise up and become their own masters.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.350
Everyone will no longer live in poverty.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.880
In this new world,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.270
every person

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.160
will have the dignity they were born with.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.610
This is the goal we're fighting for.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.150
Thank you, everyone.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:33.590
Alright.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.230
Ms. Yi,

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.330
please begin your class.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:51.810
Who is it?

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:53.620
Ms. Yi.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.200
Ms. Yi.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.170
Nanny Zhang.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.650
I finished it,

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.280
but forgot to bring it to you.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.690
This dress is so well made.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.490
You finished it so quickly.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.240
Thank you.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.440
You're welcome.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.030
Ms. Yi,

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.440
are you going to be a great writer now?

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.230
I found a job.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.010
I'm teaching night classes at a workshop.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.340
I'm preparing lessons.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.720
By the way, Ms. Yi,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.030
I actually came here today

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.510
to discuss a business plan with you.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:39.960
Look,

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.720
this dress is so well made.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.630
It would surely sell well on the market.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.830
Why don't you make clothes at home,

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.480
and I'll go find sales channels for you?

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.920
We could make money together.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.180
Wouldn't it be great to share the profit?

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.900
I don't have time.
I need to prepare my class.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.580
Well then,

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.670
how about you take 70%, and I take 30%?

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.660
Take care. I won't walk you out then.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.140
If you're not interested,

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.420
I'll find someone else to partner with.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.240
Today, I want to talk about

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.160
the history of women's clothing in China.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.540
I'll skip the distant caveman era.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.830
They probably just wore animal skins.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.910
Let's start with the Qin Dynasty.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.900
Does anyone here
know about the Qin Dynasty?

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.250
What about the story of Lady Meng Jiang
weeping down the Great Wall?

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.400
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.580
Lady Meng Jiang lived
during the Qin Dynasty.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.180
Their clothing back then

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.000
should've looked like this.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.980
The fabric at that time

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.440
was similar to

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.050
what rural people still weave today.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.380
Back in the Qin and Han periods,
black was considered noble.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.510
It's very different
from the situation today,

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:06.720
where red and yellow are favored.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.510
Zhou,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.110
did you know?

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:12.030
Yang actually grew up in the countryside.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.480
His mother

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.770
was just an ordinary peasant woman.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.240
Their life back then was extremely hard,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.810
and they were literally
living hand to mouth.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.580
Later,

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.400
his father passed away.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.000
So basically,

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.730
his widowed mother raised him by herself.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.890
They went through so much suffering.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.600
Then the Communist Party came.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.750
They overthrew the landlords
and distributed land to the peasants.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.960
From then on, they lived a better life.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.200
And then, what happened?

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.110
Well, he joined the army, right?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.640
After he joined the army,
he took up his post.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.640
Just look at him—

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.110
he has always been working hard
and always striving to improve.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.590
No wonder Mr. Yang was

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.200
so focused and dedicated in his work.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.590
Speak of the devil!

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.110
Who is it?

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.710
Director.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:06.960
Mr. Yang's back.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.720
He's back?

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.480
Comrade Zhou.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.200
He's back.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:09.920
Director.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.310
I'm back.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.300
How's everything?

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.910
Why did you rush back?

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.030
Did you finish everything at home?

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:17.920
Yes, it's all taken care of.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.320
I want to get back to work.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.530
No need to rush back to work.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.640
Right now, the city's

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.130
focusing on rectifying
neighborhood affairs.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.660
It might involve
quite a few business people.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.200
And the city also requires us to cooperate

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.240
with Neighborhood Working Committee

Sure.

You’ll be in charge
of this neighborhood rectification.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:45.870
I guarantee I'll complete the mission.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:46.500
Good.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.270

Right away.

Please.

Are you sure you're alright?

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.550
Mr. Yang, you came to work so early!

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.010
I didn't sleep last night.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.030
Surprised?

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.440
Have you had breakfast?

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.160
Not yet.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.190
I've got a cucumber here.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.480
Thanks.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.030
You can have it.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.350
I was just getting hungry.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.280
Go ahead and eat.

Have you had breakfast?

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.750
I haven't eaten yet.

It's fine. Go ahead and eat.

Let's eat together.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:38.830
Thanks.

Do you only have a cucumber for breakfast?

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:45.790
No. I had corn yesterday.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.510

Let's bring that person in.

Yes.

Mr. Yang, wait a moment.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:07.920
Hold on, Mr. Yang.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.880
Mr. Yang, just a second.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.810
What's going on?

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.710
I forgot something.

Alright, let's go.

Please have a seat.

No need. Let's discuss work first.

Last night,

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.750
I reviewed the report you submitted.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.350
In your report, you mentioned that,

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.270
lately, there have been
Yiguandao activities in this area.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:34.880
Yes,

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.110
I've reported the specifics.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.830
Yiguandao's leader is using small favors

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.350
to recruit members and expand the network.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.750
From what I can tell,

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:45.990
many people

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.450
have infiltrated the residents' committee.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.650
Our committee was just established

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.640
and has appointed many people
from various backgrounds.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.440
Their backgrounds are complex,

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.190
and they're highly adaptable.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:57.730
We need to target these people,

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.250
and crack down on them.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.410

Mr. Yang, you're still here.

Why are you here this late?

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.240
I thought you were still working overtime.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.910
I was worried you'd be hungry,
so I brought you some food.

Why would I be nervous?

Isn't this exactly
what being nervous looks like?

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:15.290
It's so typical.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.010
Where did you get the sewing machine?

Did you steal it?

Did your family lose a sewing machine?

Why did you bring up irrelevant people?

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.860
What do you mean by irrelevant people?

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.620
My personnel file is still at the factory.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.250
Comrade Su is my leader.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.650
Does she sound irrelevant to you?

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.810
You recognize it, don't you?

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.910
Take a good look at it yourself.

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:04.080
This is

a sample dress you made for Zhang Guihua.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.120
Zhang Guihua took it
to sell on the market.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.240
You disrupted the market

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.440
and made huge profits.

What do you mean?

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.320
Yes, I made this dress.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:15.780
I gave it to her as a gift.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.240
Why did you give her a gift?

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.960
What was your intention?

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.240
She asked me to make this dress!

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.240
Yes,

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.510
I wanted to keep good relations
with my neighbors.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.640
Is that not allowed?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.800
You wanted to keep
good relations with neighbors?

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.800
Is Zhang Guihua here?

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.040
Bring Zhang Guihua in.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.420
-Where's Zhang Guihua?
-Zhang Guihua.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.200
Coming! Coming!

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.790
Excuse me, guys, please make way.

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:41.830
Oh my.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.240
Mr. Yang.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.290
Take a look at her. Do you know her?

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.350
She's an old friend of yours, isn't she?

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.940
Come on.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.660
Repeat what

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.040
you just told me,

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.330
so she knows exactly

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.300
what deal you had with her.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:57.930
Say it.

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.260
Mr. Yang, well,

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.810
let me explain this for you.

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:03.810
Actually,

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.950
I didn't want to help her at first.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:07.970
She asked me to sell that dress for her.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:09.780
I felt soft-hearted and agreed.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.680
I didn't make any money from it.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.060
What are you talking about, Nanny Zhang?

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.790
How could you make up such lies?

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.840
When did I ever ask you
to sell this dress?

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.120
I made this dress,

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:18.880
because you asked me to make it for you!

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.590
You...

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.170
You need to show evidence
when you say something like that.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:21.940
What evidence?

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.200
How can you say such nonsense?

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:23.880
Who's talking nonsense?

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.790
She is!

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:25.350
Listen to me.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.610
Although Zhang Guihua

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.180
made mistakes before,

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.820
she's still trustworthy.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.240
The comrades can vouch for her, right?

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.070
How can you prove she's telling the truth?

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.300
Then how can I prove
you're telling the truth?

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.380
You just said

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.610
she's a leader of Yiguandao.

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:40.880
Then... what about you?

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.320
What's your position?

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.950
I'm asking you—

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.400
do you have anyone backing you?

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.200
Explain it clearly to everyone.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:51.590
If you say I have someone backing me,

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.980
then the organization is my backing.

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:56.240
I put my trust in the organization!

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.050
Minister Wen once said

00:32:58.390 --> 00:32:59.920
the organization
wouldn't let a bad person go

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.640
and would never wrong a good person.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.220
But Minister Wen doesn't represent

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.240
the organization and the government.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.000
Then tell me,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
is what Minister Wen said

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.240
right or wrong?

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.450
Excuse me.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:11.070
Make way, please.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.110
You...

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.030
Mr. Yang.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:15.570
Did you all hear that?

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:17.930
This woman

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.570
has committed illegal acts,

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:20.770
but refuses to admit them.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:22.090
She's from your unit,

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.710
isn't she?

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.940
Her personnel file
is at your unit, isn't it?

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.410
You must take full responsibility!

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:27.780
Your unit must be held accountable.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.830
Come. Stand here.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:29.670
We'll continue the investigation,

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.400
until we get to the bottom of it.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.710
Zhang Guihua confessed that

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:58.980
you made a business plan with her.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.510
You were responsible
for designing and making clothes,

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:05.710
while she sold them on the black market.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.610
She also said all the ideas were yours,

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.190
and that she only agreed reluctantly

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.760
after you persuaded her.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:17.580
Is what she said true?

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.820
I was thinking,

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.969
since you didn't have a job

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:28.230
or income before,

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.150
making some clothes to get by

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.310
is something we can understand.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.110
But...

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.230
when it comes to

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.150
making a business plan...

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:40.440
that's absolutely unacceptable!

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.409
I didn't make any business plans.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.840
Before the case is clarified,

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.170
your classes will be suspended.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.690
If you have any difficulties in life,

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:53.510
Ms. Yi,

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.090
you can ask the organization for help.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.110
I have no difficulties.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.690
This place is just unbearably hot!

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.400
I told you,

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.230
I have several vacant villas

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:24.360
that you can move in anytime,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.920
but you insist on staying here.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.110
It's stuffy and hot.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.840
You know I sweat easily.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:36.110
I just changed into this new outfit,
by the way.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.760
If you have something to say, just say it.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:49.290
Today,

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.320
I went to the working committee
to ask about your case.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:53.870
The person in charge said

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:54.870
this rectification campaign

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.400
has dealt with
a large number of bad elements.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.230
That Zhang Guihua from your neighborhood

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:00.960
has already been sent back to her hometown

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.090
to undergo reform
under local government supervision.

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:06.150
She also mentioned your case,

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.480
said it's quite complicated.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.550
They plan to send people
to your mother's home in Chongqing

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.810
to investigate your family background.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:15.420
Got it.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.120
And Minister Wen...

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.510
at such a critical moment,

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:22.970
he went on a business trip!

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:28.520
You also think Minister Wen
cares about me as an individual?

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:30.520
I thought he sympathized with you.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.760
Minister Wen is a leader.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.630
He cares about the fate of

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.430
intellectuals as a collective.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.960
If he were truly just

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.160
sympathizing with me as an individual,

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.250
that would make me truly hopeless.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.550
Yi, listen to me.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.050
We should leave Shanghai.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.360
First, let's avoid people
like Yang Xue'an.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.320
Let's go back to Chongqing.
I have friends there

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.320
who can set you up with a decent job.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.480
You know me.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.320
Alright then.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.650
Since you’ve decided
not to leave Shanghai,

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.760
if you need any help,

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.920
come to me anytime.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.080
Sis.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.120
Sis.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.420
Sis.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:30.010
Sis!

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:31.820
Zhaoyuan...

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.540
is not a KMT member!

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.230
Where is he?

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.100
That's good news.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:57.880
Sis.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.360
Zhaoyuan

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.120
joined the Communist Party

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.960
while he was
in the KMT army during the war.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.760
He's not a KMT member!

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.700
He's an underground Communist.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.480
Ms. Yi Yi.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.710
After a thorough

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.480
and careful investigation,

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.400
the organization has confirmed
that your husband, Comrade Zhou Zhaoyuan,

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.470
was a loyal member of our Party.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.480
Is he still alive?

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.260
He was betrayed by a traitor
before the liberation.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.670
Comrade Zhou Zhaoyuan

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.840
was killed by the reactionary government.
He died heroically.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.230
His glory and his legacy

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:53.150
have been passed on to you.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.380
You must be strong.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:00.880
You must carry on his spirit.
