[Episode 6]

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.710
You okay?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.640
What are you trying to do?

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
What do you think?

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.630
I've already taken care of everything.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.390
You'd better not do anything now.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.720
You've taken care of it?

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.280
How?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.410
By bowing and scraping

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.930
with that fake smile?

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.560
I have my own methods.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.430
I don't have time to explain to you now.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.630
I have my methods too.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.070
Don't get in my way.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.680
Cheng Ao.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.000
Everything comes to him who waits.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.090
If you go after Dong now,

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.090
break his arm and cripple his leg,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.750
you might feel it's resolved.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.640
But will Siyun's hospital be able to open?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.700
We'll need Dong's help in the future.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.970
He's not the only

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.180
powerful one in Shanghai.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.120
There are plenty of ways and people

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.910
who can help Siyun open her hospital.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.710
Like who?

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.190
You or me?

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.820
It isn't that jerk anyway.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.600
Let's stop arguing.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.870
Nothing serious happened, right?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.690
I promise if there's a next time,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.790
I'll deal with him together with you.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.690
It's quite lively down there.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.450
Yes, it is.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.710
Miss Lin.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.210
Mrs. Shen, I'll be going now.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.930
Alright.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.760
Mrs. Shen.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.470
Where did you go just now?

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.630
Aunt Nan.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.960
Siyun just went to
see under-secretary Dong.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.300
Dong is too bold.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
He tried to take advantage of Siyun.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.160
Who introduced under-secretary Dong
to Miss Lin?

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.750
I think it was me.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.360
Miss Lin.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.070
I understand your original intention
for opening a maternity hospital.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.000
And I know how important

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.330
this hospital is to you.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.950
As long as it can be opened smoothly,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.390
no matter how difficult it gets,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.250
I'm not afraid.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.960
It's hard for a woman to get things done.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.000
But no matter how difficult,
I'll still do it.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.400
Otherwise, why would I
have studied abroad in the West?

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.350
I must open

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.120
the hospital.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.490
I'll go with you

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.070
to meet those businessmen later.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.190
You two men.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.290
You can't even protect a girl.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.560
Don't worry.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.550
I won't let this happen again.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.680
It's fine now.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.750
It's about time.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.950
I'll go down with you.

What?

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.950
Trying to comfort me?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.360
No need.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.310
If under-secretary Dong
had stayed any longer,

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.440
he definitely would've regretted it.

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.680
Are you sure about
Mr. Cheng's feelings for you?

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.460
♪ Hurry, let's all dance the rumba ♪

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.560

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.659
I just saw Mr. Cheng was

You can't hide the look in your eyes
when you like someone.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.840
You'd better make sure.

♪ Blow the trumpets loud and clear ♪

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.330
What kind of person could possibly be

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.890
better than my daughter?

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.240
Cheng Ao.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.760
Do you have feelings for Lin Siyun?

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.240
I just don't like you.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.790
So you're saying
Lin Siyun is better than me?

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.740
She is indeed excellent.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.560
Something's wrong. Director Shen.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.170
There's a dead man in the restroom,

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.170
covered in blood.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:39.830
Who's dead?

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.640
Close all the exits.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.750
Notify the police station.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.810
Check every vehicle passing nearby.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.430
Alright, let's talk another day.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.120
Sure.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.310
Who would dare
take such a huge risk to kill him?

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.250
I bet it's the Eliminate Spies Squad
of the Communist Party.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.040
What do you think?

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.970
Not interested.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.630
Let's go, Siyun.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.789
I need to stay and handle other matters.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.789
Make sure you get Siyun home safely.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.770
As long as she stays away from you,

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:38.960
she'll be safe.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:39.919
Let's go.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.770
You only know
how to take advantage of others.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.040
Tell me how you found the body just now.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.200
At first I was cleaning near the restroom.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.860
Suddenly,

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.530
I heard a yowl.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.670
So I followed the sound,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:57.910
and saw that person

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.730
already lying on the floor.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.920
Did anyone

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.640
pass by here before that?

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.290
I...

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:09.840
don't remember.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:11.670
Think again.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.650
I remember now.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.660
A man in a western-style servant's uniform

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.080
walked out of the restroom
around that time.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.320
What happened tonight

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.070
is our Shen family's fault.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.170
Please, everyone, go home first.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.510
Tomorrow my wife and I will personally
call on you to apologize.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.150
We're truly sorry for this.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.130
Director Shen.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.200
Distinguished guests.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.320
You don't need to investigate further.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.370
I'll see you out.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.590
No need.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.740
We can't let our matters

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.510
interfere with your duties.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.650
The investigation must continue.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.280
Mr. Zeng, thanks.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.030
If there's nothing else,

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.910
I'll take my leave.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.550
All right.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.720
Thank you.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.920
This certificate was issued
just the day before yesterday.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.720
Orders just came down from above

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.520
that anyone with certificates
issued within the past 7 days

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.720
must be taken to
the station for questioning.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.270
Take him away!

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:21.630
Yes, sir.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.440
Wait, bro.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.120
Just a moment, excuse me.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.770
I'm sorry.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.120
This gentleman came with me.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.830
He's Mr. Zeng's friend.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:32.720
I'm sorry.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:34.930
Who are you?

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.260
I'm Mr. Zeng's adopted son,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:37.890
Cheng Ao.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.440
Sorry,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.360
but we have strict orders

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.580
to thoroughly check everyone.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.550
Bro.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.860
This gentleman is

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.150
a friend of my son.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.000
He and my son

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.410
may leave with me, right?

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:55.540
Of course, Mr. Zeng.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.440
Please.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.430
Thank you.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.910
She's my fourth concubine.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.130
Pleased to meet you.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.240
Cheng Ao.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.820
Come to my place

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.910
tomorrow.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:54.870
Yes.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.080
Thank you for today.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.740
The checks are strict lately.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.600
Take care.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:20.840
I will.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.680
Take care.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.150
Let's go.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.370
My fourth concubine.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.630
Wait.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.690
The car is over there.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.900
You're worried about him.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.120
Who is Mr. Gu exactly?

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.210
Why would the police want him?

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.150
What I mean is,

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.750
if you ever

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.420
see Mr. Gu again,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.510
you need to be careful too.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.530
Got it.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.200
Why are you looking at me? You're driving.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.490
Watch the road.

A hospital?

I'm not planning to
open a restaurant for Yingying anymore.

Even if I opened a restaurant for her,

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.720
she'd only come with her friends,

Yes.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:24.540
Hello?

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.350
Hey, bro,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.750
so you are there after all.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.680
I couldn't find you,

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.440
so I called Miss Lin's place.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.260
How did you get this number?

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:31.740
I...

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.720
I got it

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.320
when we were
collecting debts from her family.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.150
You haven't changed your number?

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.300
I will soon.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:45.970
What's the matter?

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.760
Bro,

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.720
my brother Xiaoshan is in trouble.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.240
Can you help me out?

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.130
I don't deserve such praise.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.920
I should serve the party and country

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.380
even at the cost of my life.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:01.620
Understood.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.070
I'll arrange it right away,

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.270
and will definitely
give you an answer tomorrow.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.750
Okay.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:06.580
Goodbye.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.270
Do me a favor.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.110
Have a seat and tell me.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.610
I have a young relative

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.070
who joined a training camp

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.660
organized by the Shanghai military,

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.120
and was suddenly arrested

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.870
on charges of
collaborating with Communists.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.410
What did he do?

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:30.200
During training,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.260
an instructor was preaching that

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.000
we must first eliminate internal threats
before fighting external ones,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.070
and to win the war,

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.970
a soldier's primary duty

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.230
is to eliminate the Communist Party,

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.330
and only secondarily

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.990
to resist Japanese invasion.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.870
The kid didn't understand and asked

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.500
why wiping out
the Communists was considered

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.640
the first priority over resisting Japan.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.740
Just that one question,

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:51.870
and he was arrested.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.400
Wasn't the kid right?

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.770
Isn't this what all Chinese people feel?

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.920
How could they charge him
with being a Communist sympathizer?

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.120
If you put it that way,

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.520
then millions of Chinese people

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:10.690
would all be Communists.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.530
Bro, stop right there.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:14.530
Don't let anyone hear you.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.830
You don't need to
explain these principles to me,

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.510
regarding the Chairman's strategy,

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.310
in my position,

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.200
I can't express any opinions.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.720
Just tell me directly

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.110
what you need me to do.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.310
I've made inquiries.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.310
The kid is still being
held at the military school,

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.070
about to be transferred
to the Military Police.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.750
Once he's transferred
to the Military Police,

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.950
his chances are slim.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.550
You have many connections.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.720
Help me get him out.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.420
Good heavens,

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.400
this is such a serious matter!

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.130
I don't have that kind of power.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.750
The training camp address

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.950
and instructor's name are here. Hurry.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:47.930
Well...

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:51.990
What else are you taking out?

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:03.900
Cheng Ao.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.160
You're quite practiced

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.350
at this game.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:10.960
Alright.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:13.720
I'll help you

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.100
with this matter.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.400
Leave the training camp address

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.380
and instructor's name

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.170
here.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:20.970
Take your money back.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:22.640
We're close friends.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:24.720
Besides,

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.260
this isn't something money can solve.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.630
Take it back.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.240
Wait.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:45.650
For tonight's booze.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:47.710
Look at you.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.950
You still drink?

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.910
Your stomach is already bad.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.270
Give me two more bills

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:54.050
to buy stomach medicine.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:54.540
Shut up.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:56.240
I'm leaving.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.380
Wait for my news.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:04.870
Doctor.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.220
How is my brother doing?

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.210
Three broken ribs, ruptured spleen,

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:09.670
and neurological damage.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.950
Bro.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.790
Please help me.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.240
I want to sue them.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.140
Stay with your brother first.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.220
I'll go back to my office for a moment.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.700
Bro.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.510
Xiaoshan's case
has gained public attention,

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.810
surprisingly many people from
all walks of life are supporting him.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.070
Mr. Lu has been working very hard on this.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.070
Xiaoshan is an anti-Japanese youth.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.640
He has the people's support.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.680
Those dark forces can't stop this.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:06.880
What are you talking about?

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.240
Director Shen, you're here in person.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.770
Am I not welcome?

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.070
Of course you are.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.900
Hello, Director Shen.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.750
Cheng.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.720
I'll go to the court
to get the documents, bro.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.270
So?

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.550
How confident are you about this trial?

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.070
What's more important about this case

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.600
is winning public support.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:38.920
Wait a minute.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.890
Why are you

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.320
so interested in this case?

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.610
From what I know about you,

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.130
you should be keeping your distance.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.370
The great Attorney Cheng
finally asks for my help,

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.370
so I should put in some extra effort.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.900
Take a look at this.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:03.920
Where did you get this?

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.600
Never mind where I got it.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.260
This will definitely help you
control people's minds.

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:11.210
But Cheng Ao,

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.130
this is as far as
I can help you with this matter.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.400
The rest is up to you.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:16.630
Let me warn you.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.910
This isn't nearly as simple as you think.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.200
I've done some research,

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.130
and that kid is incredibly brazen.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:23.510
He can't just be

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:24.900
a simple patriotic youth.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.300
There must be political forces behind him.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.070
Let me give you some advice:

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:31.270
stir things up, let them fight each other,

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.220
keep your distance,

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.390
and you won't lose no matter who wins.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.160
That's a lot of information.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.640
Shen Yiqun.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.710
Is this guy

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.010
your political rival?

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.280
Pretty much.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:57.630
No wonder.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.230
I'm leaving.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.820
Thanks.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.890
You're welcome.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.070
Auntie, I'm back.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:17.480
Yi.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:19.850
Come on, give it to me.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.310
Auntie, your hospital
is doing really well.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:29.910
I can finally move back home.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:32.280
Miss Lin,

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.520
long time no see.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:34.920
You are Zhou?

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.760
I just came to help Yi move in.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:42.580
Yi,

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.200
I've moved all your stuff in.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.710
If there's nothing else,
I'll be going now.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:46.390
Okay.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.180
Miss Lin, I have matters
to attend to at school,

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.510
I'll come visit another day.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.020
Okay.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.210
I'm leaving.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:53.990
Goodbye.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.200
Auntie, what are you smiling about?

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.130
You tell me.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.310
Alright,

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:10.010
let me show you your room.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:10.530
Okay.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.800
This room in our house

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.620
has been converted into nurses' quarters.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.550
The hospital just opened
and isn't making much profit yet.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:22.850
Once we start earning money,

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:24.760
we'll rent a place outside,

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.370
but for now, we'll have to make do.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:27.000
Okay.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.480
Liu,

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.190
which bed is reserved for Yi?

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.350
This bed is unoccupied.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:32.550
It's reserved for Yi.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:33.170
Thank you.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.920
Auntie, this place is really nice.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.620
Can I invite my classmates over?

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.310
You can't go to the treatment areas,

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.440
just stay in the dormitory,

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.160
and don't disturb others who are resting.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:47.750
Got it.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:50.330
You tidy up here.
I need to get back to work.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:50.860

Japan

for saying just one sentence
during training,

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.080
was detained and beaten severely,

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.960
has not yet recovered enough
to leave the hospital,

and cannot appear in court.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.480
I imagine everyone is curious

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.510
about what kind of

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.170
treasonous statement he made

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.330
to suffer such punishment.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.940
During the training session,

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.720
the instructor repeatedly emphasized

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.110
that to resist foreign aggression,

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:57.240
we must first pacify internal unrest.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.160
First, establish internal stability,

00:36:59.160 --> 00:36:59.990
and then

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.000
focus on resistance.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.940
Xiaoshan didn't understand,

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.400
what's the cause and effect here?

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.440
Nonsense!

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.800
This student was sent by the Communists

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.920
to sabotage us.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.490
He was acting under Communist orders.

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:14.730
He admitted it himself.

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.190
Yet you're defending him.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.690
Are you a Communist too?

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.560
Before I came today,
a government official

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:24.470
told me almost the same thing.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.990
He said Xiaoshan's motives
go beyond simple patriotism.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.250
He must have
powerful forces behind him,

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:33.710
and he was sent by the Communist Party
to subvert patriotic students.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:35.090
But the truth is,

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:38.920
you're suppressing
a genuinely patriotic student.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.940
I'm Wu Xiaoshan's classmate,

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.290
from Heilongjiang.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.070
Now I can't return home,

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:46.570
because the Japanese have occupied it.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.590
Our relatives back home
have become slaves in a conquered land.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:50.970
Xiaoshan is not a Communist,

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.260
and neither are we.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.000
We just want to defeat the Japanese devils

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.390
and liberate the Northeast provinces.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.390
I don't want to be a slave
in a conquered country.

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.500
I want to go home!

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.070
We refuse to be slaves
of a conquered nation.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.030
We refuse to be slaves
of a conquered nation.

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.150
Order in the court!

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:22.480
Your Honor,

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.780
I would like to ask the defendant,

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.730
are you truly Chinese or not?

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.800
Why am I imprisoned

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.440
just for expressing my patriotism,

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.300
beaten, cursed, and humiliated?

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.250
Why do you insist I'm a Communist

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.300
when I declare

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.230
my resistance against Japan
and love for my country?

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.230
Let me tell you,

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.920
I am not a Communist.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.010
But I do support the Communist Party's

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:57.280
anti-Japanese stance.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:00.790
That is typical Communist rhetoric.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:02.630
The school's investigation of you

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:05.360
is entirely based on
your communist tendencies.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.150
What has the school done wrong?

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.830
You're young and naive,

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.510
where did you get these ideas?

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.820
Someone must be influencing you.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.890
Wu Xiaoshan has made it very clear

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:19.070
that he supports the Communist Party's
resistance against Japan.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:21.590
What's wrong with
supporting resistance against Japan?

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:23.840
Not wanting our beautiful homeland
to be taken by enemies,

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.170
what's wrong with that?

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.500
What's wrong with
not wanting our homes trampled upon?

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.920
If you insist

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.120
that he has powerful forces behind him,

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.320
then yes, he does.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.230
You.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.070
You.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.000
You. You. You. You all.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.850
Including me,

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.240
we are all part of this force.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.740
This powerful force is 400 million

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.490
Chinese compatriots who refuse
to be slaves of a conquered nation!

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.670
Cheng Ao, I'm heading
back to the newspaper.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.030
I'm going to write an article

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.540
and try to get it published
in the next day or two.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.140
Okay.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:23.410
Thank you for your hard work.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:24.470
We're all Chinese.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.700
Today's court hearing
was truly impressive.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.340
I'm off.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.400
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.070
Ao.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.470
Do you think

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.070
we can win this case?

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:37.270
I can't guarantee it.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:41.490
Why the long face?

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.800
Public opinion is already on our side.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.230
Didn't Mr. Lu say

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.980
that people are
very concerned about this case,

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.260
and it's having such a big impact?

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.390
So why are you still looking so gloomy?

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:51.480
Xiaoshan.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.660
In fighting this lawsuit,

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:55.970
besides seeking justice for you,

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.740
isn't it just as important

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.070
to convey to the public

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:03.000
that you patriotic youths stand firmly
against Japanese aggression?

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:04.760
I understand, Ao.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.320
I have another thing

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.250
I'd like to ask for your help with.

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.800
Sure.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.050
My classmates and I

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:18.920
are planning to return to the Northeast

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.320
to join the anti-Japanese volunteer army.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:23.760
No problem,

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.400
I'll make the arrangements for you.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:27.510
Thank you, Ao.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:30.320
Are you tired today?

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:31.610
What would you like to eat?

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:32.590
Let's go together,

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:33.250
my treat.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:34.590
I'm hungry too.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:35.110
Let's eat together.

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:36.320
You idiot,

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.060
can't you read the room?

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.680
Did Miss Lin invite you to dinner?

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:42.240
She wants to treat Ao to dinner,

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.700
and you're just
going on about being hungry.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.150
It's fine.

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:48.960
Let's go together then.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.270
Ao said

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:53.240
it's fine,

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.680
so let's go together.

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:02.600
So

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.690
let's go together.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:05.550
No thanks, bro.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.130
We're going for noodles.

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:08.260
You go with Miss Lin.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.420
You're not coming?

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:11.230
The three of us can go.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.080
Bro.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:19.890
I'm not really hungry,

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.110
but I need to help Xiaoshan.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:22.340
How can I let you support him?

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.030
Come, bro.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:24.110
Weren't you going to eat noodles?

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:25.510
I can help him, it's fine.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:26.630
Miss Lin.
